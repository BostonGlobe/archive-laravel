<p>
In 1928, when Philip L. Carret ran one of the country's first mutual funds, there were just two trustees looking over his shoulder: his mother and a prominent Boston lawyer descended from a Colonial settler. Carret himself was the third trustee. He had $60,000, invested in stocks like <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MYG" target="_new">Maytag</a> and Standard Oil. Virtually all the money belonged to the Carret family and their friends.</p>

<p>
Two generations later, mutual fund boards remain bastions of gentility. But they now oversee $7 trillion in assets, and recent federal investigations suggest they have failed in their mission to fully safeguard the interests of the investors -- despite being paid handsomely to do so. A Globe examination of numerous mutual fund boards found they bred a culture of complacency.</p>

<p>
Since September, federal and state regulators have handed down $2 billion in fines to 19 firms involved in trading abuses. Most of those actions focused on fund executives. Now the Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on how trustees let so much go wrong on their watch. This week, the agency is scheduled to vote on sweeping changes to how mutual funds are governed, in a bid to give trustees more power, and to hold them to a higher standard.</p>

<p>
Typically, trustees are appointed by other board members. They are professors, retired executives and accountants, and former senators, who often hold their seats well into their 70s, and sometimes until death. Their work is kept secret from the investors who pay their salaries, and there is virtually no way for investors to hold them accountable.</p>

<p>
''There are any number of people who would die for a trustee position,&quot; said Joseph Barri, a partner at the law firm Hale and Dorr in Boston who advises fund trustees. The demands of the job are quickly rising. But until recently, Barri said, trusteeship had been a cushy post that attracted little outside scrutiny.</p>

<p>
''They get to go to Palm Beach once a year, and three other quarterly meetings where they're wined and dined,&quot; Barri said. ''It's not a bad job.&quot;</p>

<p>
A Globe review of hundreds of public mutual-fund documents detailing the activities of the 1,800 trustees who oversee most of the nation's fund assets found numerous instances of trustees earning six-figure pay and sizable perks, often for working no more than a few days a month.</p>

<p>
The 18 trustees of the <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MER" target="_new">Merrill Lynch</a> funds together make nearly $4 million annually for their work, which requires them to attend eight days of meetings a year.</p>

<p>
As <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=C" target="_new">Citigroup</a> bought a string of fund companies over the years, the number of trustees grew to 68. The average trustee makes $79,000 a year, is 66 years old, and does not have to retire until age 80.</p>

<p>
Trustees of  <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=AMR" target="_new">AMR Corp.'s</a> American Advantage funds get free travel on American Airlines -- plus cash to cover the taxes on the benefit. When they turn 70, they lose their vote on the board, but they can still attend meetings and get $40,000 worth of air travel yearly.</p>

<p>
The independent chairwoman of First American Funds in Minneapolis nearly doubled her pay in the past two years, to $190,000<strong>,</strong> mainly because of higher meeting fees. She gets $15,000 per board meeting and $7,500 per telephone conference.</p>

<p>
At Putnam Investments, trustees can look forward to<strong> </strong>annual pension payments exceeding $100,000, for as many years as they served on the board. When they die, their heirs get the checks.</p>

<p>
Trustees have a broad, if vague, job description: to oversee all the operations at a fund group. Their most basic role, under federal regulations, is to choose the company that manages the funds,<strong> </strong>and to agree on how much customers should pay for that service. The shareholders -- investors, retirees, and the like -- actually own the funds. The mutual fund companies are hired hands that invest the funds at the pleasure of the trustees.</p>

<p>
Many trustees say they devote significant portions of their meetings to grilling fund managers on investment strategy, risk, and how they're doing compared with their rivals. They are mindful, they say, that customers care deeply about their investment returns. But boards rarely exercise their ultimate power -- to fire a firm that's doing a poor job.</p>

<p>
In one rare instance, trustees of a Navellier fund in Reno, Nev., in 1997 voted to fire Navellier because the firm's chief executive wanted to merge the fund into another at the company but did not explain why that would benefit customers. However, the trustees couldn't secure enough shareholder votes to seal the deal.</p>

<p>
Today, few trustees seriously consider firing fund companies, according to interviews with dozens of board members. Rather, they see their duty as pressing for improvements in fees and investment results. Critics say that trustees are too passive, however, and that they often lack the will or the resources, such as outside consultants and lawyers, to negotiate aggressively with fund executives on behalf of investors.</p>

<p>
''There is an imbalance in the power and authority of trustees on the one hand, and the investment firms on the other,&quot; said Pablo S. Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute and a trustee at the Citizens Funds, a Portsmouth, N.H., group of socially responsible funds. Eisenberg, who made $17,000 for his board duties last year, said, ''It's very hard for many trustees at mutual funds to know what's going on.&quot;</p>

<p>
The SEC commissioners on Wednesday are expected to take a step toward shifting that balance of power, by addressing what many critics say is an inherent conflict of interest at many funds: when the chairman of the trustees also runs the company.</p>

<p>
The most notable example is Fidelity Investments chief executive Edward C. Johnson III. He is one of four executives at the Boston fund giant who also serves as a trustee of the funds. It's impossible, according to regulators, for Johnson to step into the boardroom wearing both the hat of a man whose company benefits from collecting customers' fees, and that of a trustee with a fiduciary duty to get shareholders the best deal.</p>

<p>
A lot is at stake. Fidelity's trustees, led by Johnson, annually must renew the investment contracts for 280 mutual funds. Fidelity charges its customers about $3 billion a year to manage and invest those funds. That accounts for about one-third of Fidelity's total revenue.</p>

<p>
Johnson denies there is a conflict. He has argued publicly that, as an owner of Fidelity and a major investor in the funds, it's in his best interest to treat shareholders fairly. If he doesn't, shareholders will buy other companies' funds.</p>

<p>
Marvin L. Mann, head of the 10 independent trustees of the Fidelity funds, agrees with Johnson. Mann said he and his colleagues ''aren't shrinking violets,&quot; and have no trouble taking on Johnson.</p>

<p>
Johnson and Vanguard Group chief John J. Brennan have lobbied heavily against a rule to require all trustee chairmen to be independent, but the SEC commissioners are likely to adopt the measure in their vote this week, according to executives briefed on their plans.</p>

<p>
The stepped-up governance standards are long overdue, many fund analysts say. At most fund companies, trustees appoint their own colleagues, set their own compensation, and are rarely subject to a shareholder vote, said Max Rottersman, founder of the Internet newsletter FundExpenses.com, which helped analyze trustee data for the Globe.</p>

<p>
''They have a long way to go to show they're not walking in lock step with management,&quot; Rottersman said.</p>

<p>
Historically, fund executives have been cozy with outside trustees, even naming or approving the trustees in some cases. Only in the past decade have some boards instituted nominating committees to select independent trustees. And there remains a legacy of fund executives serving on boards who at times wield influence over the other trustees.</p>

<p>
For example, the Putnam Investments funds for years paid two insiders on the board, even though many of the independent trustees found the arrangement offensive, because the board's powerful chairman, George Putnam II, argued strongly for the compensation.</p>

<p>
For about a decade, the funds paid then-chief executive Lawrence J. Lasser and former <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MMC" target="_new">Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.</a> chairman A.J.C. ''Ian&quot; Smith&quot; as much as $190,000 a year each for their board service. Such pay is rare; hardly any insider trustees receive compensation from funds, according to SEC filings studied by the Globe and industry norms cited by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the industry's trade group. The SEC says such pay creates a conflict, because insiders have a relationship with the fund manager.</p>

<p>
''They're paid for doing their job. They don't need to be paid for the governance role too,&quot; said C. Meyrick Payne, a partner at Management Practice Inc., a Stamford, Conn., firm that consults to fund boards<strong><strong>.</strong></strong>Indeed, Lasser received the board pay on top of earning the biggest paycheck in the mutual fund business: He pocketed $105 million during his last five years at Putnam.</p>

<p>
''It bothered the trustees, there's no question,&quot; said John A. Hill, the independent trustee who took over as chairman of the funds in 2000.</p>

<p>
When Putnam -- son of the company's founder and a 30-year executive of the firm -- retired as a trustee four years ago, Hill urged the board to eliminate the pay for Lasser and Smith immediately. ''Everybody felt uncomfortable about the pay and wanted to do it,&quot; Hill said.</p>

<p>
Putnam still stands by his view on pay for trustees. ''All trustees should be treated equally in compensation,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>

<p>
Lasser and Smith didn't lose out.<strong> </strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan took on the expense -- paying $200,000 extra per year to the two executives. Smith, in an interview, said, ''It certainly is a demanding assignment. Somebody has to pay me for it.&quot;</p>

<p>
Lasser and Smith reaped another perk that Putnam trustees receive: a retirement benefit equal to half their pay during active board service. As of July 2000, when the funds stopped paying them, Lasser and Smith had accumulated annual pension benefits of $93,333 each, which Lasser would receive for eight years and Smith would get for six.</p>

<p>
Lasser's lawyer declined to say whether the retirement payments were included in his recent $78 million separation agreement with Putnam. Lasser was ousted in November, after regulators sued Putnam for fraud. Marsh &amp; McLennan, which owns Putnam, accused Lasser of failing to react to market timing and report the improper trading by fund managers to the trustees. Lasser declined to comment for this story. Putnam has settled the fraud charges.</p>

<p>
Smith said he had no knowledge of the retirement money, though the details are in Putnam's SEC filings. ''Frankly, I wouldn't want it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>
Until the past year, trusteeship has been comfortable for many people. The Globe found that pay exceeding $100,000 per trustee is common at 40 major US fund groups, which represent the majority of the industry's assets. More than 110 fund trustees earn in excess of $156,000, the average annual compensation of directors at the nation's 200 largest public corporations.</p>

<p>
Edward J. Boudreau Jr., former chief executive of the John Hancock Funds, who wants to become a trustee at another firm, estimated that the typical trustee at a small fund group puts in two eight-hour days, four times a year, plus 20 hours of preparation for each meeting. Add another 40 hours a year for phone calls, he said, and that's a total of 184 hours annually -- or the equivalent of 23 work days. By that math, at $75,000 a year, a Hancock trustee makes $3,261 per day.</p>

<p>
''That's probably a reasonable wage,&quot; Boudreau said.</p>

<p>
James H. Bodurtha, the lead independent trustee of the Merrill Lynch funds, said his board, one of the highest-paid in the business, puts in more time than the two days every quarter they report in government filings. He said the Merrill Lynch trustees also had about 28 telephone meetings last year. He said the panel, which oversees about $57 billion in fund assets, does a better job than most, despite the higher-than-average fees collected by the Merrill Lynch funds.</p>

<p>
''We have an extremely talented group of people on our board,&quot; said Bodurtha, a lawyer who made $183,000 as a trustee last year. ''We do way more work as a whole than most boards do.&quot;</p>

<p>
On many fund boards, executives of the fund company stay on as trustees after retiring from their full-time jobs, so technically they are independent. Executives at many fund groups, including Dreyfus Corp., Oppenheimer, Alliance, and AMR Investments, the Fort Worth, Texas-based sponsor of the American Advantage Funds, have assumed instant status as independent trustees --  collecting the pay from shareholders that that role affords them -- despite their many years on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>
At Dreyfus, Joseph S. DiMartino was named chairman of the trustees in 1995, when <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MEL" target="_new">Mellon Financial Corp.</a> acquired the New York mutual fund firm. He was pushed out of his job as president of Dreyfus as a result of the deal and was immediately handed the job of trustee chairman.</p>

<p>
DiMartino keeps an office and a secretary at the company's Park Avenue headquarters in Manhattan, paid for by the Dreyfus fund shareholders. He earned $815,938 last year -- more than any other US fund trustee, according to a database of trustees, provided by Management Practice Inc., that was examined by the Globe. DiMartino, 60,  makes three times what the typical Fidelity trustee earns, but he monitors only one-tenth as many long-term fund assets.</p>

<p>
DiMartino did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>

<p>
At the <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MWD" target="_new">Morgan Stanley</a> funds, Charles A. Fiumefreddo, 71, remained chairman of the funds after retiring as president of the firm's investment group in 1998. He earned $360,000 from the funds last year, more than any of the independent trustees at Morgan, according to SEC filings.</p>

<p>
A company spokeswoman said Fiumefreddo earns more because he provides ''administrative services&quot; to the funds. The company declined to describe those services.</p>

<p>
Change is coming slowly to mutual-fund boards, some of it sparked after the fraud at <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=ENRNQ" target="_new">Enron Corp.</a> spurred new governance rules in corporate boardrooms and led mutual fund trustees to assume the spotlight would be on them next. Many funds have created independent audit committees. Increasingly, funds are introducing a mandatory retirement age of 72. Retirement plans are being phased out.</p>

<p>
The trustees of the MFS Funds in Boston decided in 2001 to eliminate their retirement plan, which promised annual payments equal to 50 percent of trustees' active pay, or an average of $75,000 for each retiree. The plan was grandfathered to cover all trustees in place at the time. That year, eight of the MFS funds' 15 independent trustees were over 70. The independent members' average age was 69. Six of those trustees have retired in the past two years.</p>

<p>
Around that time, between 1999 and 2003, MFS allowed ''widespread market-timing trading&quot; in nearly a dozen of its funds, according to the findings of an SEC investigation, which resulted in a $225 million settlement with the firm. Four company executives who served as trustees in that period, and two who served before 2001, all had firsthand knowledge of the improper trading, according to allegations by regulators and a Globe interview with a former senior MFS executive.</p>

<p>
As for the other trustees, they helped approve prospectus language that effectively permitted MFS to allow $2 billion of market-timing activity at the firm by early 2003, so long as it didn't ''disrupt portfolio management strategies and harm fund performance,&quot; according to the SEC's lawsuit against the firm.</p>

<p>
MFS settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the charges, though the company acknowledges that it had certain large funds set aside for market timing.</p>

<p>
Current MFS trustees, who made an average of $154,733 each in 2003, declined repeated requests for comment.</p>

<p>
Market timing, or the rapid trading in and out of funds, was not a well-known practice outside the industry until the abuses were uncovered last fall. Within mutual fund companies, few executives realized the practice was going on under their noses.</p>

<p>
Hill, the head of the Putnam trustees, said he and the other nine outsiders on the board of the $150 billion fund group were angry that they were not informed of market timing until last fall, three years after some Putnam executives knew of the problem.</p>

<p>
''We've asked ourselves many times, 'How could we have known?' &quot; Hill said. ''If they want to keep it quiet in a big organization, frankly, it's very difficult for the trustees to find out.&quot;</p>

<p>
The Putnam trustees took home a combined $2.5 million in 2003. Hill argues that's a bargain when spread across 11 million shareholders -- about 23 cents per customer. Each trustee spends about 500 hours a year on fund work, Hill said, or a week per month. He has typically put in 1,000 hours yearly, he said, but it has been a full-time job since October.</p>

<p>
Hill, 62, a partner in a private-equity firm in Greenwich, Conn., makes one of the largest trustee salaries in the country. Last year, he earned $388,250. ''To the person on the street, I know what I make is outrageous,&quot; he said. But last year's embarrassment aside, Hill thinks investors get their money's worth.</p>

<p>
<strong> </strong>In the late 1980s, Putnam trustees refused to approve any new fund launches until Putnam's customer service improved, Hill said. On his five-year watch as chairman, he noted, the trustees have saved investors $500 million in fees. For years, Hill and other trustees were uneasy about two kinds of fees the funds pay. One is the so-called 12b-1 fee, paid to brokers<strong> </strong>to entice them to sell Putnam<strong> </strong>funds. The SEC has allowed the fees for 20 years, on the theory that the more assets a fund gathers, the lower the fees per investor. But many trustees are rejecting that thinking, asserting that fund companies, not investors, should pay for marketing.</p>

<p>
Putnam executives often said that cutting the fees would put Putnam at a disadvantage to its competitors, Hill said. ''That was always the argument. 'If it's legal and it's approved industry policy, why can't we do it?' &quot; the executives would say, according to Hill. But last year, the trustees all but eliminated those fees, saving shareholders about $265 million, Hill said. After last year's market-timing scandal, Hill said, ''Our board finally said, 'No.' &quot;</p>
