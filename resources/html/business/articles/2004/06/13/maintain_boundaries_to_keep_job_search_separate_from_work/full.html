<p>
My sister recently left her rsum on the printer at work. A week later, her boss called her at home at 10 p.m. to state that the company president had seen the rsum and knew my sister was looking for another job. The boss also said they were going to start interviewing a replacement right away, and as soon as they found someone suitable they would let my sister go. He said they didn't want to be &quot;caught short&quot; when she found another job and resigned. This sounds illegal to me. Is it?</p>

<p>
In Massachusetts, almost all employees are employees at will. As an employee at will, your sister was vulnerable to being fired by her employer for any legal reason at any time. Doing so by calling her at home at 10 p.m. was an insensitive way to conduct the firing, but the employer is not doing anything illegal.</p>


<p>
According to Marc Greenbaum, professor of law at Suffolk University Law School, &quot;By leaving her rsum in the printer, your sister forfeited whatever expectation of privacy she may be deemed to have possessed.&quot; Leaving a rsum on the printer at work is the equivalent of the adolescent girl leaving her unlocked diary in plain view for her mother to find. As Freud said, &quot;There are no accidents.&quot;</p>


<p>
Did your sister -- perhaps subconsciously -- want her boss to find out that she was job hunting? Maybe she had been unhappy in her job for a long time but was afraid to leave before finding another position. &quot;Forgetting&quot; her rsum on the printer at work made the decision for her.</p>


<p>
Perhaps your sister hoped for a different outcome. We have all heard stories of valuable employees who are able to negotiate higher salaries and promises of expanded responsibilities after their bosses get a whiff of their intention to job hunt.</p>


<p>
The fact that the boss and the company president fired your sister over this one incident makes me wonder whether the employer, in fact, had been dissatisfied with your sister's performance. Her boss could have chosen to initiate a frank discussion with your sister, about her unhappiness at work and her desire to leave. Obviously, that didn't happen.</p>


<p>
On the other hand, the employer did not consider your sister's actions to be a serious enough breach of conduct to result in immediate expulsion. Now the employer is holding your sister hostage to their timetable to ensure that the company is not short-staffed. If your sister leaves before her replacement is hired, the employer could claim that your sister has resigned and perhaps try to deny her unemployment insurance compensation or a credible reference.</p>


<p>
It's important to maintain a complete separation of work and the job search. Here are some  rules to help others avoid your sister's fate:</p>


<p>
Never use work time to job hunt.</p>


<p>
Never use an employer's resources -- the computer, the printer, the fax machine -- to support your job search.</p>


<p>
If you must contact a prospective employer or headhunter during regular business hours, do so during your lunch hour. To be on the safe side, use your cellphone or a pay phone outside of the office.</p>


<p>
If you are at work and are using your computer, always assume that the employer has access to what you are writing and reading.</p>

<p>
for entrepreneurs</p>


<p>
I have been working at my job for two years at the same preschool. I want a change -- not from the children -- but from my job. I majored in dance. I have a small business in creative movement, which is working with children using their bodies through movement and music. Children's dance and music are my passion. I want a different job along those lines but one that pays well.</p>


<p>
I am impressed by your energy and enthusiasm for working with children. You've managed to start your own business on the side while working full time, which isn't easy.</p>


<p>
Here are two excellent resources in the Greater Boston area for fledgling entrepreneurs:</p>


<p>
The Small Business Administration, whose Massachusetts District Office is located in Boston at 10 Causeway St., Room 265. The phone number is 617-565-5590. The SBA, in partnership with the Service Corps of Retired Executives, offers free workshops on career development.</p>


<p>
The Center for Women and Enterprise, located at 124 School St., Suite 700, Boston. Check out its  website at www.cweboston.org to learn more about its  programs and services.  A free general information session is scheduled for Aug. 3.</p>


<p>
By working with these organizations, you can determine if being an entrepreneur is a good fit for you. If so, you will be asked to write a business plan to help you determine how viable your venture is.</p>


<p>
In the meantime, there are several low-cost ways for you to get the word out about what you do. Word-of-mouth from satisfied current and past customers is priceless. Remember to ask specifically for referrals to potential new customers.</p>


<p>
Consider purchasing an ad in your local paper, a free weekly shopper, or in the Boston Parents Paper.</p>


<p>
Develop a business card with an eye-catching logo and print  a colorful flier.You can access a number of free or low-cost resources on the Web to help you design an effective business card, including business card template software. Or, you could go to a place such as Kinko's or <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=SPLS" target="_new">Staples</a> to have your business cards made for you at a modest cost.</p>


<p>
Post your business cards and fliers on bulletin boards wherever parents with children tend to congregate: supermarkets, the Y, your neighborhood coffee shops, churches and synagogues, private preschools and daycare centers, and dance and music studios.</p>


<p>
If you decide to pursue another job rather than start your own business, think carefully about what makes you unhappy in your present job, and what an ideal school setting might be like for you. Some factors for you to consider as you job hunt include: the educational philosophy of the preschool, level of parent involvement, the age of the children you'll be teaching, the amount of responsibility you will have, your colleagues, and the socioeconomic and cultural background of the children in the school.</p>


<p>
Any of these factors can have an impact on whether or not the position is right for you. In addition, consider the location of the school, your commute, and the salary.</p>


<p>
No jobless benefits in</p>


<p>
a voluntary separation</p>


<p>
I have been an education coordinator/site coordinator at a nonprofit agency. A new director was hired and eliminated my position. I was offered a teaching position at $3 to $4 less per hour and my hours reduced from 40 to 35 per week. I cannot afford to work at this pay. I went to human resources to ask if there were anything available comparable to my current job. I was told no and if I didn't take the teaching job, I would have to quit and therefore be ineligible for unemployment compensation because there is &quot;full-time work&quot; being offered to me and I am refusing to take it. It is my intention to find another job at a comparable rate of pay somewhere else but I would need unemployment to help me while I'm looking. Am I required to take this job at much less pay and hours just because it's available? Is it true that this is seen as a voluntary separation and therefore not eligible for unemployment compensation?</p>


<p>
If you decide to leave your employer, most likely you would not be eligible to collect unemployment insurance benefits. According to the state's Department of Unemployment Assistance, your situation would likely be adjudicated as a voluntary separation. In instances when an employee leaves voluntarily, the matter of unemployment compensation rests on whether or not the employee had an &quot;urgent and compelling&quot; reason to leave.</p>


<p>
When someone is being transferred to another job but wishes to decline the alternative position and still collect unemployment benefits, DUA looks at whether the new position is consistent with the claimant's skills, experience, and training.</p>


<p>
If the reassignment were well outside the general scope of your current job classification or not relevant to your skills and training, you could make the case that the new position is &quot;unsuitable.&quot; As the job that has been offered to you is one that you have previously performed, it is obviously a position for which you are qualified. Although your most recent position involves a higher level of responsibility than you will have as a teacher, this discrepancy in responsibility is not a determining factor in your eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits. Instead, your eligibility rests solely on whether you are qualified to perform the job that you were offered, which you clearly are.</p>


<p>
Remember that even if you were eligible to collect unemployment benefits, your unemployment would replace at the most only half of your lost earnings.</p>


<p>
Your new assignment, even with its significant reduction in pay, will result in comparatively greater earnings for you, at least until you find re-employment with another nonprofit agency at a level commensurate with your most recent administrative experience and compensation.</p>


<p>
Despite being offered a demotion with a significant reduction in salary, the good news is that you still have a job. It may help you to adjust to your situation if you look at your reduction in hours as a gift that will enable you to devote extra time to searching for another position.</p>
