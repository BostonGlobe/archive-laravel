<p>
EVEN AS POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP runs amok in Washington, one figure seems to float serenely above the fray &#150; Alan Greenspan. For all the requisite grumbling of left-leaning op-ed columnists and Archie Bunker types howling for a return to the gold standard, Greenspan remains something of a sacred cow. After all, this was the man who steered the economy out of the wake of the '87 stock market crash and into a decade of economic growth unparalleled in American history.</p>

<p>
Last month, President Bush duly nominated Greenspan, with effusive praise, for a fifth and</p>


<p>
most likely final term as Federal Reserve Chairman. And even as Senate Democrats slammed the Bush economic record in confirmation hearings last Tuesday, they walked on eggshells to hurrah the man chiefly credited for the long boom of the &#146;90s &#150; a stretch that saw the creation of millions of jobs and untold wealth amid remarkably tame inflation.</p>


<p>
But now, even as most of America cheers the victory lap of the man Bob Woodward dubbed &#147;Maestro,&#148; some increasingly loud jeering can be heard from an unlikely quarter &#150; the investment community. There, an eclectic, contrarian bunch are saying that Greenspan blew it. Rather than being a demigod who watches munificently over America&#146;s economic recovery, they claim, the 78-year-old Fed chief presides over an economy that, despite an unprecedented one-two punch of monetary and fiscal stimulus, remains in danger of stumbling precisely because of Fed policies. To these critics, Greenspan&#146;s real legacy is one of regulatory malpractice, political meddling, and a tricky new asset bubble whose bursting will soon shower pain on Wall Street and Main Street alike.</p>


<p>
. . .</p>


<p>
The Federal Reserve primarily controls interest rates by setting the Federal Funds Rate, the short-term rate that influences the long-term rates baked into everything from mortgages to car loans. Greenspan can also talk up or down long-term rates through his monetary bully pulpit. Low rates entice consumers and businesses to borrow and invest &#150; just what the doctor ordered in a weak economy (think how unappealing it is to have your money sit in a CD yielding 1 percent). Higher rates are in order when a healthy economy pushes prices up and the Fed wants to rein in spending (you&#146;d be far more keen on that CD at 7 percent).</p>


<p>
But to many of Greenspan&#146;s critics on Wall Street, the Fed chairman has made poor use of that policy toolbox &#150; particularly when it came to addressing the late 1990s stock market bubble, the most expensive such boom-bust episode in economic history.</p>


<p>
Indeed, if Greenspan had a trademark moment, it was his December 1996 warning of the market against &#147;irrational exuberance&#148; &#150; classically gnomic Greenspeak meaning that equity valuations had gotten too giddy. The market briefly sold off. But Greenspan would only increase rates once, in March 1997, as stocks continued a record bull run that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq nearly double and quadruple, respectively, by the turn of the century.</p>


<p>
Eventually Greenspan slammed on the brakes with six interest-rate hikes between June 1999 and May 2000 &#150; way too late, say critics, to forestall a bubble that had already gotten out of control. As the indices crashed back to their mid-&#146;90s levels by 2002 &#150; snuf&#64257;ng out trillions in market value &#150; Fed watchers wondered why Greenspan had waited so long to act forcefully on his original telegraph. Things had gotten so bad, in fact, that the Fed had to U-turn into aggressive rate-cutting by January of 2001.</p>


<p>
&#147;He&#146;s been irresponsible,&#148; asserts David Tice, a prominent short-seller who manages the Prudent Bear group of funds. &#147;Greenspan should have taken a stand and made the tough choices. Instead, he will go down as one of the worst central bankers of all time.&#148;</p>


<p>
Tice speci&#64257;cally faults Greenspan for indulging the cardinal Federal Reserve moral hazard: the idea that investors taking all manner of risks can ultimately count on the Fed to bail them out of bad bets &#150; whether by cutting rates or otherwise signaling an easy monetary outlook. He points to the fall of 1998, when Greenspan swooped in to slash rates three times as stocks were tanking on the heels of the Long Term Capital Management and Russian currency debacles. Instead of absorbing the impact of those crises, the market whiplashed into a rally, and within months tech-and-Internet mania was lifting the indices to fresh all-time highs. Tice also cites as irresponsible Greenspan&#146;s open embrace, in 1999 and 2000, of the &#147;new paradigm&#148; economic thinking &#150; in which leaps in productivity would allow for high growth and low unemployment without inflation &#150; that diminished the intended tamp-down effect of his rate hikes.</p>


<p>
Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust and another outspoken Greenspan critic, agrees this was a reckless posture. &#147;There was this feeling that the central bank is there as a backstop,&#148; says Kasriel. &#147;It&#146;s a strange kind of capitalism where &#145;heads, you win; tails, you break even.&#146; &#148;</p>


<p>
Not that everyone agrees that raising interest rates was a good idea to begin with. In fact, James K. Galbraith, an economist and business professor at the University of Texas, argues that the so-called New Economy &#150; bubbly, yes, but never quite inflationary &#150; needed rate hikes like a bullet in the head. Indeed, within months of his last rate increase in 2000, Greenspan once again began cutting rates to fight the whole new bugaboo of deflation, a general, persistent decline in prices that prompts lower economic demand and even lower prices.</p>


<p>
&#147;The interest rate is just this terribly blunt instrument,&#148; says Galbraith. The only way rate hikes really work, he asserts, &#147;is by throwing the economy into recession.&#148;</p>


<p>
&#147;He crushed the market when there was no statistical evidence of in&#64258;ation,&#148; adds Donald Luskin, a former money manager who is now chief investment of&#64257; cer at economic consultancy Trend Macrolytics. The core problem all along, insist both Galbraith and Luskin, was unbridled speculation, as Wall Street egged on day traders and retail investors into bidding market capitalizations to absurd heights. To best target these excesses, they argue, Greenspan should have tightened restrictions on margin accounts (brokerage credit that allows stock purchases at a fractional up-front payment), a regulatory lever he failed to pull.</p>


<p>
&#147;Greenspan&#146;s major failing is this tendency to defer to the great gods of the market and not get involved,&#148; says Galbraith. But even as he questions Greenspan&#146;s hands-off attitude toward the market, Galbraith assails his excessive involvement in another area &#150; politics (a line of criticism almost never heard on largely Republican Wall Street). The Fed chair, Galbraith says, irresponsibly signed off on the Bush tax cuts by suppressing his belief (as communicated to then Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, and reported this year in Ron Suskind&#146;s book &#147;The Price of Loyalty&#148;) that they should be linked to the budget surplus. &#147;He blew a lot of his reputation on the Bush tax cuts,&#148; says Galbraith. &#147;He absolutely has a hand in our &#64257;scal mess.&#148;</p>


<p>
. . .</p>


<p>
Greenspan&#146;s supporters still have his back, however. &#147;He stayed a little bit too loose too long during the 1990s,&#148; concedes Christopher Probyn, chief economist at Boston-based State Street Corp. &#147;But you have to believe that his tenure has been successful.&#148;</p>


<p>
&#147;Spoiled investors are still smarting from Nasdaq 5,000,&#148; adds Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting, who also would prefer to highlight the entirety of Greenspan&#146;s 17 years in office, one of the sunniest periods in US economic history. &#147;Returns have been abnormally good, inflation and unemployment simultaneously low. And their problem is. . . ?&#148;</p>


<p>
Surely not high borrowing costs. Thanks to 13 rate cuts in three years, the Fed&#146;s chief interest rate now sits at a 46-year low of 1 percent (down from 6.5 percent as recently as January 2001). That kind of easy money has spurred record home-mortgage refinancing, which in turn has plowed gobs of consumer dollars back into an economy that has had to stomach dot-bomb, 9/11, and a spate of corporate scandals. &#147;It&#146;s like renting helicopters and dropping money out of them,&#148; says Brian Wesbury, chief economist at the investment bank Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson.</p>


<p>
Wesbury is no inflationary Chicken Little; three years ago he was among those calling for Greenspan to slash rates aggressively in order to combat deflation. Now Wesbury argues that the 1 percent rate is dangerously and unrealistically low &#150; at least three points too cheap, considering that core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) is closer to 3 percent. (Many economists believe that the Fed Funds Rate should run one to two points above core inflation.) The upshot: If the rate should now be at least 4 percent, then Greenspan has a lot of hiking to do. Says David Tice, &#147;Greenspan&#146;s been giving uppers and cocaine to a patient who needs to sleep.&#148;</p>


<p>
That is a particularly worrisome read if we are in a housing bubble. According to Prudent Bear, total mortgage borrowings jumped by a record $1 trillion last year, nearly four times the average annual growth of the &#146;90s. Nationwide, home prices surged by an annualized 18 percent in the final quarter of 2003, with many markets (including Greater Boston) outpacing that clip and some seeing prices double in less than four years. As their paychecks and stock portfolios tread water, homeowners borrow off these gains, assuming they can pay up when they sell at high prices. The supposed killing to be made in the hot real estate market, moreover, remains a conversational mainstay at cocktail parties, the very forum that not too long ago enthused about CNBC&#146;s Money Honey and Amazon shares at $400.</p>


<p>
James Grant, editor of the influential Grant&#146;s Interest Rate Observer, calls the 1 percent main rate &#147;an emergency rate without an evident emergency.&#148; He worries that the inevitable fixing of that imbalance will sting Americans who signed on to adjustable-rate mortgages, particularly those with volatile interest-only loans. &#147;A rise in short-term rates would have a smothering effect on housing prices,&#148; he said. &#147;I fault Greenspan for fostering the myth that he can make everything smooth and prosperous.&#148;</p>


<p>
None of this would be so pressing if the bill for the monetary fire sale of the past three years was not coming due. Inflation is rearing its head once again, with the Labor Department reporting on Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent in May, the biggest monthly increase since 2001. Traders expect the Fed to start tightening the spigots with a quarter percentage-point increase at the end of June. And Greenspan recently warned that he could have to hike rates sharply and often if prices ratchet up further.</p>


<p>
&#147;Once he&#146;s talking about it you can be sure it&#146;s yesterday&#146;s news,&#148; says Luskin, who predicts inflation will heat up, and Greenspan will indeed be forced to play catch-up with aggressive tightening. In a perfect world, a concurrently booming economy would cushion homeowners and companies from the blow of higher rates. If the economy lags, however, we could find ourselves reunited with that &#146;70s show, stagflation&#150; the dreadful coincidence of a weak economy coupled with inflation.</p>


<p>
So whether or not you love Alan Greenspan, this much is certain: He now owns this pickle. Moving too much, too fast risks choking the economy; move too little and prices could get out of control. How Greenspan weans the country off his own prescription of easy money will be the final, all-deciding measure of his legacy.</p>


<p>
Not that the particular mechanics will be within the grasp of us mere mortals. To quote the Maestro himself, &#147;If I say something which you understand fully in this regard, I probably made a mistake.&#148;</p>
