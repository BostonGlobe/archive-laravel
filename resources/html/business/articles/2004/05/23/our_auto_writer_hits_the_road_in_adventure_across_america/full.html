<p>
We are rolling in the wee hours just after midnight and have put more than 600 miles between us and six sizzling laps of a hot and twisting Las Vegas racetrack. The sun-baked track has given way to Rocky Mountain snow fields and the temperature has plunged from 106 degrees to 37 degrees.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong>I met Murry on racetracks at Porsche-sponsored events. He is also a Porsche Driving Experience instructor and he has let me drive very fast while he hoped to live. A trusting soul. We decided we should race together in an annual event called the Cannonball Run/One Lap of America. Porsche, the German builder of high-performance sports cars and sport utility vehicles, provided us with a 2004 GT3.</p>


<p>
We chose One Lap because it's one of the last great American road adventures. This year, over eight days, 82 cars attempted to travel almost 6,000 miles in long, safe hauls on public roads, and then race on seven tracks, a drag strip, and two small circles, known as skid pads, that test the cars' gripping ability. Seventy-one were still running at the end, including ours.</p>


<p>
Along the way, competitors collected more than 32 speeding tickets, racked up $58,783 in repair costs, and put their vehicles through what an auto<strong> </strong>executive called &quot;the equivalent of 20,000 miles&quot; of industry<em> </em>track testing.</p>


<p>
The run, more than three decades old, entered American folklore in a 1981 movie called &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; when Burt Reynolds and a wacky all-star cast that included Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Farrah Fawcett raced a crazy assortment of vehicles in a high-speed, illegal run across America.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong> Sponsored by Car and Driver magazine and the Tire Rack, a giant wholesaler of tires, wheels, and other auto equipment, One Lap is a unique race in that a competitor can invest over $100,000 in a car and pay $2,000 per team to enter but vie for nothing more than donations to charities or bragging rights and a trophy.<strong> </strong>Car sponsors, however, often get their product displayed in the local press, on the Internet (www.onelapofamerica.com), and in a large spread Car and Driver publishes each year.</p>


<p>
<em> </em></p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">South Bend, Ind., to Heartland Park, Topeka, Kan.: 648 miles.</p>


<p>
</span></span>Our events at tracks are run against a clock. Go out, do your laps (or hurtle down a drag strip) and record your times.</p>


<p>
Show up late at a track and 10 seconds are added to your recorded time. That is why the long transits from track to track can be so arduous, so tiring. &quot;That's like a day,&quot; says Murry, referring to the 10-second penalty, when races on tracks are often settled by tenths of a second.</p>


<p>
This year, the race began at Tire Rack's headquarters in South Bend, Ind., and ended in the same place, with wet skid pad and dry skid pad competitions that test who can get around the fastest without spinning out.</p>


<p>
The seven racetracks were either twisting road courses of about 2.5 to 4 miles long, or road courses inside large ovals with long straightaways from the ovals thrown in. Races consisted of two sets of three laps at each track. Except for at Infineon, in Sonoma, Calif., where there was one five-lap race. In addition, two sets of drag races were run at Heartland Park in Topeka, Kan.</p>


<p>
After each race, we took off as soon as we could for the long hauls between tracks. The first leg itself from South Bend to Topeka took us more than 10 hours -- and that was a short drive.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong> Drivers in One Lap included professionals, such as Murry, very good club racers, and strict amateurs. All that is required to drive the public transits is a driver's license. To compete on the track you must have racing experience or race training in your background. All shared one thing: a love of racing and virtually no crippling fear of speed.</p>


<p>
In fact, a favorite T-shirt among the racers, dancing to the dangerous edge, proclaimed, &quot;If It Can't Kill Ya, It Ain't a Sport.&quot;</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Topeka to Pikes <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=PEAK" target="_new">Peak International</a> Raceway, Fountain, Colo.: 546 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> One Lap of America began more than 30 years ago as an outlaw run from New York City to Redondo Beach, Calif. As law enforcement caught on, it evolved into the &quot;legal on the highways, fast on the tracks&quot; challenge it is billed as today. Until recently, many of the cars were pure stock<strong>, </strong>meaning they were not specially prepared for racing and came<strong> </strong>right from showrooms and driveways.</p>


<p>
That has changed dramatically.</p>


<p>
Who would have thought that a Porsche GT3, with 385 horsepower and capable of 192 miles per hour, could be viewed as &quot;The Little Engine That Could.&quot; Yet up against cars built for this event -- with horsepower at 500, 600, 750, and higher -- the Porsche was an underdog, running in the most powerful class, big bore. Other classes were small bore, luxury sedan, mid-price sedan, vintage American, vintage foreign, economy, retro, and alternative fuel. There was also an overall title.</p>


<p>
A bumper sticker proclaimed that in prepping a car to race now, &quot;The Only Rule Is, There Are No Rules.&quot; It mattered not what was done to a car to tweak and power it up for the race -- only how it began its life. That's why, for instance, a 1954 Chevrolet pickup truck could be entered as a vintage American but feature a modern, 1,050-horsepower engine<strong>.</strong></p>


<p>
In fact, one of the most surprising cars was a 2003 <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MSBHF" target="_new">Mitsubishi</a> Evo -- a compact foreign car popular with the tuner set. But this was no ordinary Evo. It packed 500 horsepower and blew everyone away at drag racing. Goodbye Vipers, Porsches, and Corvettes.</p>


<p>
It was driven by a superb driver, Paul Gerard, from Boulder, Colo., who, but for a bad start on the wet skid pad, would have contended for the Overall title.</p>


<p>
Murry and I traveled so light that other crews noticed.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong>While others towed trailers loaded with spare parts, spare tires, tools, racing fuel, and other gear,<strong> </strong>we packed only a tire pressure gauge and some Windex to clean the windshield before going racing.</p>


<p>
&quot;It's a Porsche,&quot; Murry explained several times. &quot;We don't need no stinkin' tools.&quot;</p>


<p>
The Porsche GT3 crew was dubbed, &quot;Team Squeegee.&quot;</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Pikes Peak to Infineon Raceway, </span>Sonoma, Calif.: 1,372 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> This was the longest haul among what the race organizers benignly labeled &quot;transits.&quot;</p>


<p>
That meant, drive until your eyes bulged from their sockets and revealed things that were not there -- or maybe were. Antelope flit across the headlights' arc. Ten hours into our 18-hour transit from Colorado to California, a casino pops from the desert as Utah yields to Nevada. Then desolation. And always, as we head for restorative sleep, we must watch for wildlife that roams by night: herds of elk, flitting deer, a bobcat, rabbits, and birds.</p>


<p>
Trucks are a rolling obstacle course in the mountains from Nevada to California. If racing is chess at 180 miles per hour, traversing the twisting mountain roads among trucks is checkers at 80 -- always looking for the next chance to jump.</p>


<p>
One Lappers drive by night, and noon, and morning, and evening.</p>


<p>
Murry calls home several times a day, wants to talk to Trudy, his wife; Dylan, his 3-year-old son; and if he could, would bark at Jake, his dog. And in reaching back to home, Team Squeegee exposes one myth: the lie of national cellphone coverage. It does not exist. Every few miles, the cellphones die, from the heart of America all the way to the coast.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"> Infineon to Las Vegas Motor </span>Speedway: 657 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> It's a legal race, but does anybody speed?</p>


<p>
You judge. Eighty-two cars started the race, 32 teams admit to speeding tickets, some more than one. Thirteen got warnings. One warning was for 80 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. Cop must have been a race fan, since he escorted the driver to an early morning start at the track.</p>


<p>
Tickets for Team Squeegee: 0.</p>


<p>
We always let someone go faster than us. The rule seemed to be that 10 miles per hour over the speed limit was fine, even as we rolled through radar.</p>


<p>
And it was obvious that, given driving skill, an open road, and the desolation of 3 a.m., hurtling toward the coast, it would be easy to do 140 miles per hour on the interstates, and 120 miles per hour on twisting mountain roads whose signs warned that 50 miles per hour was the limit.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong>And, let's face it: <strong> </strong>It is hard to be inconspicuous in a bright yellow Porsche with numbers on its sides and decals plastered all over as you roll on public roads. A cop picked up the Porsche in Oklahoma and tucked in behind a truck. Twice, he flicked his right turn signal and pretended to exit and then tucked back behind the truck, expecting us to bolt.</p>


<p>
Team Squeegee was not born yesterday.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Las Vegas to Pueblo Motorsports Park, Pueblo, Colo.: 813 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> Brock Yates, auto journalist and the legend who started this whole thing, warned at this year's launch that anyone on the Atkins or South Beach diets would be off them for the duration. And, indeed, truck stop food ran a greasy gamut from gizzards and livers to fried chicken. The high end is <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=WEN" target="_new">Wendy's</a> and <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MCD" target="_new">McDonald's</a>. Get fancy, and you're talking Subway.</p>


<p>
We went a week with no real utensils, eating anything that came in a wrap or between slices of bread. Can't drive and use a fork or knife. Can't eat a salad with your fingers.</p>


<p>
The only chance for exercise on this trip is part of the job. Get up early, go walk the track.</p>


<p>
Back at Heartland, the walk had taken us through a kink that had not long before killed a Porsche driver. Murry never brings up the dead man's error.</p>


<p>
Instead, he talks about how to do it right and goes out and does just that, turning a diabolical curve into a straight slice that has the crowd remarking.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"> Pueblo to Hallett Racing </span>Circuit, Okla.: 635 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> One Lappers, in part, hurry from track to track so we get some shuteye. Short naps in the car help, but real sheets and pillows are best.</p>


<p>
Because we seldom knew where we would be and when, hotel accommodations were often made on the fly.</p>


<p>
Room choices, on nights when you awaken desk clerks at 3 a.m., are not always the finest. Seldom did we pay more than $50 for our rooms. This meant, on some nights, sleeping in socks for fear of touching the carpets.</p>


<p>
A good night was a 2 a.m. arrival with a 6 a.m. wakeup call. A great night was a 6 a.m. arrival with an 11 a.m. wakeup call. In total, Team Squeegee slept between sheets for 26 hours in eight nights.</p>


<p>
Dangerous as that sounds, by careful sharing of our shifts behind the wheel, I never sensed the danger either of us might nod off.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Hallett to Road America,</span>Elkhart Lake, Wis.: 894 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> This is a brutally long haul for the next-to-last leg of a long race,</p>


<p>
Yet the friendly demeanor of the competitors has endured -- in a way you will not find in other sports.</p>


<p>
<strong> </strong> Nowhere else do you meet star athletes more accommodating to their fans than in motor racing.</p>


<p>
Any kid who approaches Murry's car becomes his own child -- sit in it, wear my helmet, grab a picture. Husbands have their wives and daughters pose with him. No autograph is refused. And the drivers display remarkable camaraderie amongst themselves.</p>


<p>
Brian Smith, a superb driver from Simpsonville, S.C., in a Viper, gives Team Squeegee a quart of oil. Murry offers tips on rear suspension, use of the banks, and tire pressure, to Smith and Mark DaVia, the two drivers who will beat him.</p>


<p>
Paul Gerard, the masterful driver whose Mitsubishi surprises all, explains to Team Squeegee why their car gasped at oxygen-thin altitudes and how to fix it.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Road America to Tire Rack headquarters, South Bend, Ind.: 288 miles</p>


<p>
</span></span> And when it was done, The Little Engine That Could did, its third-place finish just 115 points behind the 6,820 points piled up by the overall winner, a 600-horsepower, race-prepped Porsche driven by DaVia of Thompson, Conn. Smith, in a factory-backed Dodge Viper, was second, just 55 points behind the winner. Murry had pushed or bested many cars with more horsepower and more technical backing.</p>


<p>
And after a tire-smoking performance to please the fans at the Tire Rack test track, Team Squeegee tossed its empty Windex bottle, packed its gear (all two carry-on bags for the plane) and a tire gauge and headed home: Murry to Cumming, Ga., to hug his wife, squeeze his boy, and pat his dog -- and then go racing, which is where he makes his real money. And<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>went home to my<strong> </strong>family as well, ready to test-drive more cars -- which is where I make my money, too.</p>


<p>
On the road (and track) again.</p>
