<p>
Chad Gifford of FleetBoston Financial Corp. and David D&#146;Alessandro of John Hancock Financial Services Inc. sat down with Globe 100 editor Tina Cassidy to discuss mergers: the one they almost did together, and the ones they finally settled on, with Bank of America Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., and Manulife Financial of Toronto, respectively. The Fleet name will disappear, and neither institution can count Boston as corporate headquarters any longer. The two executives reflected on everything from what they dislike about this city, to gay marriage, to why it&#146;s better there&#146;s business consolidation.</p>

<p>
GLOBE: You both know a lot about a lot of places. Does Boston care more about losing a local brand than other places?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Boston is a unique place, a special place, a historic place. I got a lot of comment &#151; I&#146;m sure David got a lot of comment when he sold John Hancock. We didn&#146;t have to do it. Our job as the CEO is not to think of what&#146;s right now, what&#146;s easy for us now, but what&#146;s going to happen in the future. And that&#146;s what we did ... I&#146;m not really answering your question but I will now that I&#146;m thinking about it. We&#146;re not owned by the citizens of Boston ... we&#146;re owned by shareholders ...</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: Any town that has a Citgo sign as a historical landmark resists change. This is a town that wants progress without change ... We have a lot of institutions locally that invest in companies like ours ... They want returns but they don&#146;t want change. They want progress but they don&#146;t want change. So is it different here? Once it settles in and people take the time to understand it &#151; which your paper doesn&#146;t help, usually because they&#146;re more interested in the personality issues and other things &#151; Once people take the time to understand it, they&#146;ll understand that we&#146;re doing everything for our shareholders... Chad is right that shareholders own our companies and we are loyal to the citizens of the community. There are an awful lot of people in and around Boston and Massachusetts that have a piece of our companies through mutual funds or whatever. So there is a certain schizophrenia: Let&#146;s have progress, let&#146;s have returns, but let&#146;s not have change.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Well, the Hancock name might remain; Manulife might adopt that, is that right? Do you think that will happen?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: One of the premiums they paid for us was the name because they have no presence here. So it will remain.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Will Manulife&#146;s name disappear?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: In the United States it will.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: And Bank of Boston, BankBoston, you&#146;ve been through so many iterations.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: BayBanks, Bank of Boston, First National Bank of Boston, Fleet, I&#146;m well beyond that... There a lot of people who in the BankBoston-Fleet deal who are were so hung up on getting rid of Fleet and keeping BankBoston.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: How are you both adjusting to not being CEO?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: That&#146;s a little harder than I thought it was going to be. I was made vice chairman in &#146;87 and president in &#146;89 so that&#146;s 17 years where I was either the up-and-comer, pre-senior on the board of directors or CEO and there&#146;s no question that you don&#146;t really know what it&#146;s like being CEO until you&#146;re CEO. The buck stops there. And over a period of time I think inevitably you develop a confidence to make the right decisions and you get used to that. ...</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Will you be biting your tongue?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I&#146;m not going to bite my tongue. I&#146;m still going to express what I feel but I&#146;ve got to accept that I&#146;m not the CEO. I have to have a lot of respect for [Bank of America chief] Ken Lewis but the fact is that the buck doesn&#146;t stop here anymore. For me, it&#146;s an adjustment.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: David, how do you feel about that?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I&#146;m still CEO of Hancock and I&#146;m president of the new company, chief operating officer. The way I look at it is I&#146;ve had bosses all my life. Board of directors, shareholders. So I&#146;m not having much of an adjustment problem because I&#146;ve always felt I had a boss. And people ask that question all the time. I think the only difference is that you have to adjust to decision-making, you have to include people that you didn&#146;t include before. That&#146;s different as you get to know each other. In our case and Chad&#146;s case, alot of the decision-makers are in Canada, as they are in North Carolina [for Bank of America] so there&#146;s the geographic issue. And to me it&#146;s really a question of getting to know everybody so you can all make the right decisions.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: How long do both of you plan to stay in your current jobs?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: [laughs] I&#146;m on schedule to do exactly what I&#146;m supposed to do, which is stay, become president next year. And I assume that&#146;s going to happen on time. No reason not to believe that. I&#146;m only 53 so I have some time left, but I have lots of interest in the world also. So, we&#146;ll see.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Lots of interest outside of &#151;</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: My identity, my personal identity, our whole identity is not in our jobs.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: What else would you like to do?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I&#146;ve written a couple of books; maybe I&#146;ll get to write another one. I have a strong interest in sports. My days of playing second base are over...</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Running a baseball team or a football team?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I don&#146;t know about running a baseball team &#151;</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: David will be running something else in significance &#151;</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: Thank you, Chad. I like the entertainment world. It would be fun to do something else someday. But right now I have a job.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I think it&#146;s different. David&#146;s nine years younger than I. I expect that I&#146;ll be chairman of the board in 2 years and chairman of the charitable foundation. I&#146;ll be retired full time... I don&#146;t expect to be involved in another commercial venture unless it&#146;s advisory ... I think this is a great way to finish my career.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Do you regret your companies didn&#146;t get to merge? Wouldn&#146;t that have been fun?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Yes, I think it would have been fun. It would have been fun and it would have been historic. We could have done fine together. But in my opinion &#151; this is going to sound self-serving &#151; we&#146;re too honest to put together two things that sound great for our community but don&#146;t really mesh from a commercial point of view. And I think we both accepted that reality.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: Well, Being Chad&#146;s boss would have been a challenge ... [laughter] But it&#146;s an interesting thing. We get paid to make hard-nosed decisions... We get paid, Chad said the buck stops with us. One way to look at the hard-nosed decision of what kind of value could you have produced. Our companies, in the end, produced over a 40 percent premium in this market to our shareholders. It is quite unlikely that a merger of our companies would have produced any premium. and while as Chad said it looked good on paper. The only regret I really have is that I would have liked to have worked with Chad, frankly ... He clearly would have been CEO on a seniority basis and the fact that he&#146;s so much smarter than I am ... That part would have been interesting. But I just think that we would have gotten hammered in the end by Wall Street for not producing the kind of premium.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I would have learned a lot about marketing and innovation but there would have been a hell of a lot of jobs lost, too. ... And I believe more jobs lost than we&#146;ll see ...</p>


<p>
GLOBE: How are the cultures of Manulife and Bank of America different from the current cultures of your companies?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I actually think the cultures are more similar than almost any other commercial bank in our organization... Heavy on values, diversity, trying to consistently increase customer scores, employee value, employee evaluation. I&#146;m still learning part of the culture.Somebody at some point is going to define what culture means. If it means anything to me it is how an individual within a company is treated and is given an opportunity to be himself or herself.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: This culture thing is overrated... There aren&#146;t that many organizations that have cultures that are peculiar. There are few, certainly. And they tend to be peculiar because when they have been family-owned, for example, or entrepreneurally owned. Most institutions that are public companies have a blending. The thing you have to get used to is where the power bases truly are. Because they&#146;re not on paper. You find in one company for example is that the human resource department is a lot more powerful in how they operate. In Manulife&#146;s case, they were also founded in the 1800s. Most insurance companies were founded in that period of time and blossomed after the two big wars of the 20th Century, are not dissimilar. Both companies [Hancock and Manulife] were full of quants, quantification people. There&#146;s no shortage of people with mathematical backgrounds. It&#146;s just part of the nature of the beast and there&#146;s no shortage of people that are selling and marketing people...The differences [between Manulife and Hancock] are that in each company the power bases are somewhat different. I think the power base with Manulife is a very, very strong chief financial officer and a very strong investment division. They pay a great deal of attention to the finite numbers. While I thought Hancock did, Manulife is a very, very disciplined financial enterprise. That causes a whole series of different meetings that take place. You&#146;re suddenly you&#146;re taking some things for granted in the past in terms of product pricing, as an example... You&#146;re talking about culture that&#146;s what I see as one of the differences. How do things get done in a company.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: With Fleet and BankBoston there were clearly different cultures.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: And that created problems.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: It created adjustments ... Fleet was clearly more disciplined ... very analytical.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: ... The first day I had a meeting with Manulife senior executives and the Hancock senior executives. First thing out of my mouth was we&#146;re not going to have a discussion about cultures because as far as I&#146;m concerned there&#146;s only one culture, it&#146;s called Manulife. If anyone ever says that&#146;s not how we do things at John Hancock I will fire you. And so for the last eight months we haven&#146;t had any cultural problems. And that&#146;s because you get into these power struggles because people start saying things like, `That may be how you do things but we don&#146;t do it that way.&#146; And I said to people, `Look, we&#146;re not going to take the best of both cultures because I don&#146;t know what that means.&#146; Organizations need to run at a certain level of focus and discipline and I think one of the reason mergers don&#146;t work sometimes is you have both organizations struggling with power structure to do things the way they always have and individuals who don&#146;t get on the train have buckled.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I don&#146;t know Manulife. I make this observation. If I were on the board of a new company the one thing I would make sure they don&#146;t lose is innovation. I don&#146;t know what&#146;s going on with the shareholders of your company over the last couple of years but I know you&#146;ve made them all very, very happy. ... We&#146;re in a world of such change now. I would worry about a company that&#146;s overly quantitative. You&#146;ve got to be quantitative because we all got to be more productive but the word change means more to me now than it ever has and ... The only way you&#146;re going to adapt to change is if you have an environment &#151; I use the word environment, not culture &#151; that allows innovation. He demands innovation. Christ, go into his office. Look at his ties. That&#146;s the most conservative tie I&#146;ve seen him wear &#151;</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I knew I was coming over here.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Chad, Ken Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, has said his biggest problem with the $48 billion merger is the Boston media. Do you agree?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Has he said that? I honestly haven&#146;t heard him say that but if he said it then I accept that he said it. I think he&#146;s been surprised that the transaction hasn&#146;t been more positively received because as he told me ... look at the premium, the job guarantee, the philanthropy guarantee, the business is based in Boston, members of your board are on the board. He&#146;s just been surprised.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: But of course, you&#146;re not surprised by the reaction because you&#146;ve been through this so many times in this town.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I have been the subject of a few stories in the Globe.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: How would both of you describe the business climate in Massachusetts, taking into account the job that Governor Romney&#146;s doing &#151;</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I&#146;ve said for some time ... that the economy here is changing dramatically from a large-based company operational economy &#151; this will take a minute &#151; New England has always been a place where there are a lot of what we call manufacturing-type jobs and they change form. It used to be the leather business and the shoe business and the textile businesses and then we created the processing technology jobs, both manufacturing and software and then we were supposedly moving to a service economy. Now what&#146;s happened over time is those textile jobs went away, they moved to the South and they moved to Asia, the technology companies, they make chips for tiny bits of money other places in the world now. And there&#146;s nothing replacing these three series of jobs which we always had in the past. We always had these huge kind of quote manufacturing jobs being replaced and then the back offices of big corporations here. What&#146;s happening now is there is a lot of midsized companies and service-oriented companies and the economy here, to a great extent, is being driven by a hodgepodge of smaller companies. I don&#146;t know one reason that a large company would say, `Boy, we&#146;re going to come out of the Midwest where housing prices are one-third of what they are in Boston. We&#146;re going to move our entire company to Boston or to New England.&#146;</p>


<p>
GLOBE: It&#146;s not just real estate prices, though &#151;</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: It&#146;s the real estate prices, it&#146;s the quality of the workforce and what you have to pay them. The quality of the workforce is quite good here but you have to pay for it. And there&#146;s no reason that has to happen. So the business climate in my view is going to be the ability of people to understand and capture this patchwork quilt that we put together. ... And we need to see people like the hedge-fund managers and mutual fund companies step out more and be more a part of this community because for guys that make as much money as they do they are as penurious as the day is long when it comes to community giving, when it comes to political involvement. The mutual fund companies, with the exception of a couple of very large ones, there are a lot of small investment companies in this town now that have cleaved for a long time and I see these guys on the weekend in the suburbs and ...they&#146;re not involved enough in Boston. So it&#146;s a mini-lecture.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I couldn&#146;t agree more. It&#146;s the same old suspects supporting this community. It&#146;s Fleet. It&#146;s John Hancock. It&#146;s Fidelity. And I know some people say it&#146;s not going to go away; well we&#146;ve responded that I don&#146;t believe it is going to go away. New England is a little microcosm of the United States. The big issue is the outsourcing of foreign jobs. You go to India you get better product, better work quality, at a heck of a lot cheaper price.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Outsourcing has obviously been an issue at Bank of America. Do you think customers locally will react negatively?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I think customers will react with the service that is provided to them ... When you&#146;re a company you invest in your strength. The strength of this economy in New England economy, as David said, is not a large manufacturing base... The strength of the economy, however, is the small spinoffs coming through either the teaching hospitals or MIT or some of the universities. That&#146;s what we need to capitalize on. They also happen to be potentially very high-paying jobs. And I happen to believe, unlike 10 years ago, that the leadership in the Commonwealth understands and has done a pretty darned good job.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Do you think the government should be doing something specific?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: The governor I think&#146;s doing a good job of trying to grasp what I was just talking about. If you eliminate the universities and hospitals of Boston, you have Toledo. That&#146;s what you have. You have Toledo. ... And what people don&#146;t really recognize is, for example, Partners Health Care is the second-largest employer in the state, next to the state government. And what I think the governor&#146;s starting to do, which I think is right, is beginning to understand that asset. That set of assets.</p>


<p>
Because, for example, pharmaceutical companies and medical manufacturing companies need something we have, which is research doctors. And I know the governor is working on trying to attract more of that. I think he understands we&#146;re not going to get large companies to come here in the way we just described.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: And the only exception of that are the medical companies. .. We need to understand it, invest in it, facilitate it. It should be a partnership with the universities, political leadership, and businesses.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Who are you voting for for president?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I thought Americans were allowed to save that name for the privacy of the voting booth.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I just don&#146;t think it ought to be in the newspaper.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I&#146;ve decided I&#146;m definitely not voting for Nader. I&#146;m out on Nader. [Laughs.]</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Gay marriage in Massachusetts? What are your feelings?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Oh I&#146;ll speak on that. To me you don&#146;t write into the constitution something that I personally believe is discriminatory. I think it&#146;s really kind of interesting and I accept that the two words `gay marriage&#146; elicit a lot of emotion ... They have an issue with it whether it&#146;s religious, whether it&#146;s tradition, you name it. But I think, to me, like a lot of evolution in this country of rights, whether it&#146;s women, it&#146;s race, it&#146;s bound to happen. To me it&#146;s respecting the right of an individual ...</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I think the debate&#146;s ridiculous. I&#146;m absolutely for it. It&#146;s a ridiculous debate being conducted by people who suddenly have new moral platitudes... And I find it fascinating. If you went to the Legislature and said, `OK, everyone here who can claim that you&#146;ve never done something &#151; quote &#151; immoral you get to vote. There wouldn&#146;t be anybody left in the chamber. It&#146;s not possible. So all of a sudden we have all these people... The religious right on this subject and the Bible Belt, there are many more things to be serious about in this world than gay marriage. In a particular sense, there are so many children in this world that need parents that are good parents and.. there are a lot more, on a percentage basis, better gay parents today than there are heterosexual &#151; on a percentage basis. I have a 5-year-old. We have a number of friends who are gay and have children and they&#146;re wonderful parents. So I don&#146;t get the debate. What I get is the homophobia. I understand homophobia.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: In what way?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I understand that most of the people that oppose are homophobic. And they&#146;re taking up way too much time and space and public money and newspaper space that should be used on debates that count, like why are we in Iraq or what&#146;s going to happen to our economy. or how are we going to turn around the view of America in the world &#151;</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Huge issues. HUGE.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: And from a business standpoint it&#146;s a huge issue because we&#146;re trying to do business all over the world &#151;</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: You want to know what&#146;s on my mind? Bank of America needs to expand abroad. Huge opportunity for us. For the first time in a long time, is that name a strength? ... Historically that name is a tremendous strength and now you&#146;ve seen polls about what people think...</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I&#146;ve had sales people threaten to take away business unless we change our same-sex benefits program, and I&#146;ve written back to them and said we&#146;ll no longer accept your business, thank you.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: That&#146;s leadership ... I think if you got us on subjects like the war and America&#146;s position, I can get on environment and gun control and women&#146;s rights and so forth ... you write about Hancock and FleetBoston and I do think we&#146;re two individuals that understand and work for shareholders but really give a damn about the issues that David was just talking about and I think we have an enormous responsibility to, however long either one of us stays with the company, you&#146;ve asked us, we&#146;ve responded, is to do whatever we can to &#151; inspire is too strong a word &#151; encourage other business leaders, which I think they should, to take the kind of stand David did on the janitors [strike] and there&#146;s one where we really crossed swords...but David more than anybody is willing to speak up and more business leaders should ... and I know he&#146;s made some enemies doing it, will speak up, particularly given some of the crap that&#146;s been going on over the last four or five years because that does not represent business leadership.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: On the idea of expanding abroad with Bank of America, where would you look to do that?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Where we think there is the most consistent growth. [LAUGHS]</p>


<p>
GLOBE: What do you both like most about Boston? And what do you like the least?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: The thing I like the least here is the amount of public pettiness, which I find quite remarkable. When I say that the media, the gossip mongers, they turn on so many petty issues and they blow so many petty issues out of proportion and this isn&#146;t a shot at the media as much as it is the media has to have sources ... Many things happen in this town that don&#146;t deserve attention that in New York wouldn&#146;t even take anyone&#146;s time. And what I like the most, I think, is the incredible amount of caring and intelligent people here. It may sound somewhat an opposite. But there are an enormous amount of interesting and intelligent people here. The debates are always quite interesting.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: There are so many eclectic and interesting people and institutions here that whether your interest is medicine, education, business, sports, culture. You&#146;ve got it all in an incredibly historic respected city. Go anywhere and how many people just find Boston interesting. It is a fun place to be. On the other side, we&#146;re parochial. We&#146;re tribal. ... I agree with him. If I answered first I would say much of what he said. In Boston, it doesn&#146;t matter whether you&#146;re in business, politics, sports, you name it, You rise to a position of prominence, somebody somehow figures out where to put a bull&#146;s-eye on you.</p>


<p>
And instead of celebrating or trying to do that, we ought to spend more time celebrating how rich this place is. It&#146;s some of the huge successes we have seen. We don&#146;t do enough of that.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: It&#146;s a very unusual place, too, if you think about it. This a city or state that&#146;s considered extraordinarily liberal and yet we will have had, by the time Romney&#146;s term ends, 16 years of a Republican in the governorship. You ask most people in the United States is the governor of Massachusetts a Democrat or a Republican? Most will say a Democrat. How many places do you have a Mormon governor, a very Italian-American mayor, and you have a tremendous smattering of individuals that are unlike some other places. You got [John] Silber and [Larry] Summers... You&#146;ve got guys like John Henry, right? and Bob Kraft. You have this group of people that are just unlike many other cities. There&#146;s no sameness here.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: I&#146;ve gotten into a conversation with a couple of leading medical docs. There are an incredible number of unknown investment management operations that you probably never heard of whose compensation &#151; you guys like to write about our compensation &#151; we can&#146;t pay their taxes and they need to engage more but they&#146;re also fascinating people and they&#146;re very influential in this country and they&#146;re all over these buildings.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: The fact is there are literally hundreds if not thousands of these people that are making a great deal of money but have not been on the spot to be more involved in the community. You talk about the industry here. There is a subterranean industry that has been mutated in the last 25 years off of our companies and off of mutual fund companies. The hedge fund players, the guys that cleaved out of Harvard, there&#146;s thousands of those venture capital firms. That is a subindustry here that I never see anyone talk about because they can&#146;t put their arms around it. And they prefer it that way. They want the anonymity. I can tell because... They have a lot a lot of people youngish people 35 to 40 years old with whales on their pants. There are all these investment management people. They&#146;ll introduce themselves and they live in $10 million, $15 million houses and have places in Nantucket. There&#146;s a lot of those people around.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: Let&#146;s not talk about Nantucket. You can dump on whales on the pants, though.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Are the Red Sox going all the way this year?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: He&#146;s an owner so he can&#146;t say. I&#146;m so grumpy when they go on a losing streak. I&#146;m just grumpy. But you know what we have for the first time? Pitching. And pitching wins in October.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: Winning a World Series is often a fluke because everything has to come together. ... [But] this will be considered the most successful &#151; before it&#146;s over &#151; franchise in baseball. ... One thing I admire about the partners is that these guys know how to maximize the Red Sox from a revenue standpoint and John Henry has surprised me in that he&#146;s quite willing to put money back into the team. They&#146;re very dedicated to winning. I don&#146;t think they&#146;re interested in winning once. Their objective is not to win a World Series. Their objective is to have a dynasty.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: And they&#146;ve got a good model in Foxborough. The way that that organization has gone on to win the Superbowl... What isn&#146;t crazy is to say every year we are going to attempt.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: It&#146;s more likely the Red Sox win the World Series than the Celtics with the championship. That&#146;s fair.</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Final thoughts?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: There&#146;s going to be a great deal of consolidation in the financial services industry. ... We&#146;re seeing it happen all over America. It&#146;s inevitable there are going to be more and more deals. The good part for Boston is there&#146;s not a lot left here to consolidate. And &#151;</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Do you look at that as a positive?</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: I do, because we will have made that adjustment ahead of everybody else.</p>


<p>
I think there are some cities that have big financial institutions that they&#146;re dependent on may not be prepared for, especially some of the Midwest cities are not prepared to lose some of their big banks and other institutions, but it&#146;s coming. It&#146;s just a question of when and how. They&#146;re so much talk and buzz. And I think that because they see the success of our mergers there will be pressure from shareholders to get it done. But in terms of Boston in the future, I think the politicians need to grapple with what we just talked about and that is, what is the economy here, what is the base? What is the emerging base and how are we going to capture it from an economic growth standpoint and a community standpoint?</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: You asked us how we felt about this being the last time we&#146;re in the Globe 100. And I think you were a little surprised by what was said. I would be a liar if I didn&#146;t say there&#146;s some emotion, some regret. This was far and away the largest financial institution based in New England. It was the hardest part of the decision.</p>


<p>
But as we talked about here, if you are so convinced you made the right decision, that overwhelms the feeling of the nostalgia and you focus on getting on with it.</p>


<p>
As I said, I think one of my biggest challenges as it relates to the franchise to make sure that there are folks here that have the kind of social conscience that David D&#146;Alessandro has, and I expect to do that and I would also say that it&#146;s all over [the media] that the smaller banks are going to now come in and get us because we&#146;re going to lose accounts because we&#146;re part of the big Bank of America. That&#146;s just total rubbish. As witnessed by the fact that we&#146;ve grown some 14,000 household accounts since we&#146;ve announced the deal. Yes we&#146;re large, yes we&#146;re strong, yes we probably have the financial suite of products. But we&#146;ll only be successful if we deliver it in a local way. People feel like they&#146;re being treated in a local way. And that&#146;s what we&#146;ll do. Other banks like to talk that way...we&#146;ll prove it.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: ... In the life insurance business there&#146;s one claim per person, only one transaction per person... Being bigger is really important because, like in politics, you have to deliver on a local basis ... transactions cost money and efficiency counts ... So all these little banks that are dinks under any measure, the only thing they have is a sign the same size as Bank of America and Fleet. They&#146;re like puppies that are yapping at the cuffs. At the end of the day these big mergers of big companies are going to keep all these little banks just that, puppies nipping at the cuffs.</p>


<p>
GIFFORD: By the way, he and I have not talked about this interview one little bit. We haven&#146;t choreographed one word. .. reflecting on David&#146;s decision came a few months before ours and we know each other well enough to talk about industry issues, not specifically Bank of America, not specifically Manulife, but at some point people are going to realize that what we said about the inevitability of consolidation is going to happen, and look at John Hancock. David recognized that. He put together a transaction which was superb for shareholders and now we have a company whose US business is based in Boston who carries the name John Hancock ... So instead of selling out to a huge company ... we have a company whose US operations are here. And at some point people will recognize that.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: Do you think the Times would sell Chad and me the Globe?</p>


<p>
GLOBE: Probably not.</p>


<p>
D&#146;ALESSANDRO: The best thing we could do for the community is buy it and manage it for a while.</p>
