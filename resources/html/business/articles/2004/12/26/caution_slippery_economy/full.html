<p>
The economy grew at a solid pace, but jobs didn't. The technology sector finally revived, but soon began to consolidate. Airlines packed flights, but still lost billions.</p>

<p>
Even the    Labor Department couldn't make up its mind. Its survey of households showed the number of employed at a record high, while its survey of businesses showed 400,000 fewer payroll jobs than in early 2001.</p>

<p>
Despite the fits and starts, 2004 was a noticeable improvement from 2003; not great, but OK. The recovery broadened -- albeit not as quickly as hoped -- and even reached Massachusetts.</p>

<p>
The outlook for 2005: moderate growth. Risks, however, still abound. Energy prices are high, interest rates are rising, the dollar is weak, the budget and trade deficits are huge, and, with the Red Sox reigning as world champions, an apocalyptic event could yet happen.</p>

<p>
Of course, similar risks overshadowed the economy in 2004, but Americans faced them head-on. They went shopping. So with that as inspiration, here's a look back at 2004, and a glance ahead to the new year.</p>

<p>
<strong>Drip, drip, drip</strong></p>

<p>
Consistent job growth resumed, but the rate was painfully slow. Nationally, job creation surged in the spring and October, but mostly disappointed. Massachusetts, meanwhile, has yet to get to disappointing. Since job growth resumed in March, the Bay State has added only 24,000 jobs, compared to more than 200,000 lost in the recession.</p>

<p>
Economists expect modest improvement next year. One sign that things are improving: Both President George Bush and Governor Mitt Romney have credited their policies for aiding the turnaround. Oddly, when the economy was sliding, it was due to forces beyond their control. <strong>Deja vu all over again</strong></p>

<p>
The tech sector rose  from the canvas in 2004 and relived some of the glory days of the late '90s. The Nasdaq rose, initial public offerings reappeared, and in a flashback to the Internet boom, Google Inc., the web search giant, more than doubled its stock price within two months of launching its much anticipated IPO.</p>

<p>
But the year ended with signs that 2005 might recall an even earlier era: the '80s. <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=IBM" target="_new">IBM Corp.</a> sold its personal computer business to China's Lenovo Group Ltd., which analysts see as the beginning of the consolidation of hardware makers, while <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=ORCL" target="_new">Oracle Corp.</a> nearly completed a hostile takeover of <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=PSFT" target="_new">PeopleSoft Inc.</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Other people's money</strong></p>

<p>
The mutual fund industry ended 2004 where it began: mired in scandal. Government investigators are all over Fidelity Investments, trying to find out if the firm's traders lived high on the hog at the expense of brokers who completed trades for Fidelity.</p>

<p>
The probe is the talk of Boston's financial community, in part because Fidelity's competitors have long viewed the company as haughty.</p>

<p>
The broader investigation, involving dozens of firms in downtown Boston, threatens to cast a pall over the industry into the new year, as investors are likely to hear lots about the juicy fun traders and brokers were having.</p>

<p>
<strong>Virtual law</strong></p>

<p>
Finally, the nation got a law in 2004 to stanch the flow of junk e-mail. Spammers responded by sending more spam than ever.</p>

<p>
The federal law is the latest exercise in futility aimed at controlling spam, which now accounts for about 90 percent of all e-mail, according to Frontbridge Technologies Inc., an e-mail security firm. Internet companies have sued big spammers, and state governments, including Massachusetts, have won settlements against spammers. But they still haven't caught up to ''Mrs. Idi Amin."</p>

<p>
Next year, expect the big Internet companies, which squabbled in 2004, to settle on unified technical defenses against spam.</p>

<p>
<strong>Oedipus, phone home</strong></p>

<p>
AT&amp;T Corp.'s consumer long distance business all but died in 2004, struck down in large part by competition from the offspring of its break-up, the regional or ''Baby Bell" companies. One of those babies, <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=VZ" target="_new">Verizon Communications</a> Inc. of New York, even replaced AT&amp;T as a component company of the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>

<p>
Up next: a merger of cellphones and fixed-price, unlimited Internet calling, known as Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VOIP.</p>

<p>
''Think about the cordless phone in your house using VOIP, and when it gets out of the house, it roams onto cellular," said AT&amp;T chief executive David Dorman. ''That, I think, is going to be a big, big deal."</p>

<p>
<strong>Bubble this!</strong></p>

<p>
2004 was supposed to be the year that Boston's housing bubble would lose air, if not burst. But the market stayed hot, putting sales on pace to break another record and sending prices even higher.</p>

<p>
Through September, the average year-to-date price for a Massachusetts single-family home was $414,450, up 10.7 percent from 2003. But can it continue?</p>

<p>
The local market has recently shown evidence of softening, such as buyers cutting asking prices, and even Judy Moore, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, says the question for 2005 is, ''How many more buyers are out there?"</p>

<p>
But, with mortgage rates rising slowly, pessimists might have to wait at least another year to say, ''I told you so." The National Association of Realtors projects 2005 will be the second-best year on record for existing-home sales, behind 2004.</p>

<p>
<strong>Market it and they will come</strong></p>

<p>
Investors snapped up commercial real estate at a record pace, and at record prices, in 2004, but it was hard to see why. Boston area vacancy rates remain in the double digits. Rents are flat at best.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, big development deals struggled. Fan Pier was sold twice -- but the deals fell through. Frank McCourt's South Boston waterfront acreage generated ho-hum interest, and the Columbus Center project over the Massachusetts Turnpike at Clarendon Street in Boston still isn't underway.</p>

<p>
The outlook appears better next year. Space is getting scarce downtown on expensive, high floors. Financial management firms have generally stopped shrinking and started to expand, executives say. Investor interest in commercial real estate also looks strong, but rising interest rates warrant caution.</p>

<p>
<strong>Take </strong><strong>2</strong><strong> aspirin and hold, please</strong></p>

<p>
The federal government introduced discount cards for the elderly as the first step toward full-fledged Medicare prescription drug coverage. But the discount card program was so confusing that seniors jammed Medicare's toll-free information lines, and endured waits of an hour or more.</p>

<p>
Advocates for the elderly say the confusion is the result of a complex bill pieced together after a furious lobbying effort by drug companies and other special interests. And it won't get simpler when the full benefit goes into effect in January 2006. The government's main goal in 2005: Minimize the chaos as seniors sort through the rules, premiums, deductibles, and other features.</p>

<p>
<strong>Needed: Extreme makeover</strong></p>

<p>
It's hard to imagine the pharmaceutical industry's image, which last year attained the lofty levels of tobacco companies, sinking much lower. Big Pharma found a way.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=MRK" target="_new">Merck &amp; Co.</a> withdrew its pain-fighting medication Vioxx after disclosing that the drug increased a patient's risk of heart attack or stroke. <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=GSK" target="_new">GlaxoSmithKline</a> came under fire for failing to disclose trial results that said teenagers who took its antidepressant Paxil had an increased suicide risk. Prescription prices continued to rise rapidly, allowing politicians in an election year to portray drug companies as greedy bullies.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is expected next year to get tougher on drug companies. The industry's consolation: 20 percent profit margins.</p>

<p>
<strong>High anxiety</strong></p>

<p>
No industry gets more attention from state leaders than biotechnology, yet no industry is more anxious about its public standing. So the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council hired its own big-name politico to get some love, appointing former House speaker Thomas M. Finneran as the industry group's president.</p>

<p>
Biotechs are particularly worried about efforts to reimport foreign drugs, and they hope the well-connected Finneran can smooth relations in Washington, where drug makers are taking unrelenting criticism. ''It's hard enough to make a drug. It's really hard if everybody hates you," said Joshua Boger, chief executive of Cambridge cancer-drug developer <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=VRTX" target="_new">Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.</a></p>

<p>
Reimportation and the price controls will remain biotech's main concerns next year. When it can take 10 years and $750 million to bring a drug to market, anything that might cap revenue gives shivers to executives and investors.</p>

<p>
<strong>Life (sciences) is good</strong></p>

<p>
Medical device giant <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=BSX" target="_new">Boston Scientific Corp.</a> of Natick won FDA approval of its drug-coated Taxus cardiac stent system and quickly captured more than half the $4 billion market from competitor <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=JNJ" target="_new">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>. But Boston Scientific stumbled when it had to take 165,000 stent systems out of inventory after manufacturing flaws were linked to three deaths and more than 40 injuries. The company quickly recovered lost sales. Now the question is how long it will take for competitors to bring rival stents to market.</p>

<p>
<strong>No cough </strong><strong>syrup before operating</strong></p>

<p>
Sharp blades and a shaking razor would seem a risky combination. But that's what <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=G" target="_new">Gillette Co.</a> came up with to counter Schick-Wilkinson Sword's 2003 introduction of the world's first, and so far only, four-blade razor.</p>

<p>
Gillette's M3Power -- a three-blader with a vibrating battery-powered handle -- hit stores in May. While it drew some guffaws, analysts said it achieved what Gillette had hoped: stealing back the limelight from the competition.</p>

<p>
Gillette is so happy with its pulsating razor that it plans to introduce a battery-powered version of its Venus razor for women this spring.</p>

<p>
<strong>Winning sound</strong></p>

<p>
What did this year's historic Red Sox World Series Championship sound like? Ka-ching!</p>

<p>
Stores ordered nearly five times as much Red Sox gear from Twins Enterprise Inc., the Boston owner of the Souvenir Shop on Yawkey Way and licensed maker of major-league hats, than they would have ordered if the St. Louis Cardinals had won.</p>

<p>
And stores could hardly keep Red Sox merchandise on the shelves. Shreve, Crump &amp; Low is selling hordes of Red Sox key chains, money clips and pins. ''I expect these products to be part of our mix for a long time," said Merritt Mayher, the company's president.</p>

<p>
<strong>Promises, promises</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=BAC" target="_new">Bank of America Corp.</a> of Charlotte, N.C., completed its takeover of <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=FBF" target="_new">FleetBoston Financial Corp.</a> but attracted an outcry from politicians when it laid off 800 branch staffers in the Northeast and replaced them with part-timers. It also pledged to headquarter six units in Boston, but instead moved two away.</p>

<p>
The outcry prompted Bank of America chief executive Kenneth D. Lewis to visit Boston to reiterate the bank's commitment to New England. Soon after, the company moved its wealth management unit to Boston. The bank has added about 1,100 jobs in Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the past few months.</p>

<p>
Consumers, meanwhile, have few complaints. Bank of America introduced free checking and free online banking, not to mention friendly and helpful staff, and forced competitors to match it. Expect competition to intensify next year.</p>

<p>
<strong>More promises</strong></p>

<p>
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino promised the Democratic National Convention would be a boon to minority- and women-owned businesses. But of $49.6 million spent organizing the extravaganza, only about $1.6 million went directly to those firms, according to a Globe analysis of convention records.</p>

<p>
The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University calculated that the city reaped a ''negligible" benefit of $14.8 million from the convention, far below the nearly $150 million predicted by the mayor. City officials dispute that analysis but have yet to issue their own.</p>

<p>
<strong>Hard realities</strong></p>

<p>
As the number of patients demanding and undergoing obesity surgery skyrocketed last year, hundreds of medical centers, including small community hospitals, trained surgeons and opened programs.</p>

<p>
But several deaths put a damper on demand in Massachusetts, while a state panel recommended far stricter standards for the procedures that could force out smaller programs.</p>

<p>
<strong/><strong>This is a </strong><strong>business model?</strong></strong></p>

<p>
Airlines had their busiest year since 2001, but still lost billions. Two major airlines, <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=UAL" target="_new">UAL Corp.</a>, parent of United Airlines, and US Airways, will start 2005 under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. More could follow.</p>

<p>
Other major airlines also felt the squeeze of soaring oil prices that pushed jet fuel costs to record highs and fierce competition that kept fares low. Analysts predict 2005 will be a better year, but that means losing just $2 billion, compared to the estimated $5 billion in 2004.</p>

<p>
''There's still a very good possibility that we could lose a major before it's all over," said Dan Kasper, director of the aviation practice at consultancy LECG LLC in Cambridge.</p>

<p>
<strong>On the road again </strong></p>

<p>
Governor Romney couldn't get over the ads he sees on TV for auto insurance -- all produced by companies that don't do business in Massachusetts. Eager to bring in more competition, Romney pushed auto insurance reform toward the top of his to-do list. He appointed a task force to recommend a redesign of the system and ordered insurance commissioner Julianne M. Bowler to develop new rules for assigning high-risk drivers to insurers.</p>

<p>
The gloves should come off in 2005, as the state's auto insurance players try to dismantle the existing Rube Goldberg regulatory system. Watch for Commerce Insurance of Webster, the state's dominant auto insurer, to start flexing its muscle in State House corridors and possibly in court.</p>

<p>
<strong>Split personality</strong></p>

<p>
Automakers rolled out more vehicles with fuel-efficient hybrid gasoline/electric engines at the same time they kicked up horsepower in others, with Volvo and Subaru models boasting as much as 300 horsepower.</p>

<p>
Next year, look for hybrid technology to spread. <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=TM" target="_new">Toyota</a> is upping its annual Prius allocation for the United States to 100,000 -- a huge leap for a car that has sold 120,000 since it went on sale here in 2000. Toyota also said its entire lineup of autos will be offered with the hybrid option in coming years.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=DCX" target="_new">DaimlerChrysler</a> and <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=GBM" target="_new">General Motors</a> said they would jointly develop a hybrid power system for their cars.</p>

<p>
<strong>Work, work, work</strong></p>

<p>
The Bush administration eliminated guaranteed overtime pay for workers earning $100,000 a year or more, and those in managerial or supervisory positions. But the move may not have much impact. Workers already appear too scared to ask for extra pay.</p>

<p>
One study showed that some Americans were so fearful of losing jobs in a down economy that they worked longer hours and didn't even take all their vacation.</p>

<p>
And even if you're brave enough to go away, it's getting even harder to disconnect from the office.</p>

<p>
Siemens Communications Inc., the big technology firm, is predicting that in 2005 more employers will adopt new technology to integrate e-mail, voice mail, cellphones, and personal digital assistants to make it easier for bosses to find you. Happy New Year.</p>
