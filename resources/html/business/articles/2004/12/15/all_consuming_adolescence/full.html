Before she was even in high school, Miranda Zappala began to hear the siren song of Madison Avenue. And that ubiquitous youth-marketing tune -- whose lyrics consist of ''Buy, buy, buy&quot; -- has only grown louder for Zappala and the rest of her generation.</p><table

<p>
''At 13, I started reading YM and Seventeen and being influenced by it, and seeing all the cool new things to buy,&quot; says Zappala, a 17-year-old senior at Duxbury High School. ''I started thinking: 'Oh, I should get that.' &quot;</p>

<p>
''Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was the cool thing,&quot; she recalls. ''Then it went from Abercrombie being the best thing to have to Coach bags and UGG boots, which range from $200 and up. And people wear them. . . . Here all the girls have Coach bags, UGG boots.&quot;</p>

<p>
Even Cambridge, home to counterculture values, is not immune. ''In our school, it's a competition,&quot; says 15-year-old Gifty Mansour, a sophomore at Cambridge Rindge &amp; Latin, as her friend Najma Abdullahi nods in vigorous agreement. ''It's like you're not going there to learn; you're going there to dress.&quot;</p>

<p>
At younger and younger ages -- and not just during the holiday season -- kids are being deluged with advertising messages pushing them toward a consumer's-eye view of the world. Everywhere they turn, they are exhorted to purchase (or badger their parents into purchasing) pricey items that range from the techno-chic (iPods, camera-equipped cellphones, personal computers, video games) to the just plain chic (jewelry, cashmere sweaters, designer-brand jeans).</p>

<p>
Amanda Garces, 15, a sophomore at Newton South High School, says she has noticed that in magazines aimed at teenagers, ''every fifth page is an ad.&quot; Consequently, she says, high schoolers ''identify the idea of being cool [with] buying up every new product that comes on the market: all the new clothes and perfumes and shoes.&quot; While Garces isn't buying that notion or those products, she says some friends have succumbed to those blandishments and have become ''very materialistic and always looking to buy things.&quot;</p>

<p>
Which is precisely what Madison Avenue has in mind. Moreover, the trend toward youth marketing will probably only intensify because the massive purchasing power of the nation's teenagers -- who now number nearly 34 million -- makes them such a tempting target. Spending by youngsters aged 12 to 19 is expected to hit $169 billion this year, up from $122 billion just seven years ago, according to Michael Wood, vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a market-research firm based in Northbrook, Ill.</p>

<p>
But kids today feel the effects of systematic marketing campaigns well before age 12. As early as elementary school, the status-symbol competition is underway.</p>

<p>
''From when I was really little, it's always been from kids [who] have it and expect other people to have it also,&quot; says Mimi Silk, 15, of Brookline. Recalls Zappala, of Duxbury: ''In fifth grade, it was, 'I have 38 Beanie Babies.' Now it's, 'I have four Coach purses.' &quot;</p>

<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Ads, ads, everywhere</span></span>In Brookline, Silk says, a female lacrosse player recently suggested that, in the interest of team spirit before a big game, ''Tomorrow, everybody wears UGGs. One girl said, 'What if we don't have UGGs?' She just assumed everybody had UGGs.&quot;</p>

<p>
Of course, teenagers have always faced the pressure to conform to prevailing styles. But what is different today, experts say, is the intensity of advertisers' focus on children and adolescents as consumers -- in many cases, well before their capacity for judgment has been fully developed.</p>

<p>
''This is a phenomenon that has been growing for a while, but the explosion is pretty recent,&quot; says Juliet B. Schor, author of ''Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture.&quot;</p>

<p>
Those living with that ''explosion&quot; are the parents, and in their voices can be heard a combination of puzzlement, dismay, and anger at the way children have been turned into customers.</p>

<p>
''It's excessive,&quot; says Rosario Camara, 42, of Cambridge, mother of a 9-year-old boy. ''It's natural that all kids want the latest whatever. But they are bombarded with all this information. Everything is so commercialized that in the end, they pay less attention to the simple things.&quot;</p>

<p>
But Dan Jaffe, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, says critics are pointing the finger in the wrong direction. Jaffe maintains that the advertising industry is already ''one of the most regulated areas in the country,&quot; especially with respect to preteens. As for teenagers, while they are ''expected to understand by a certain age what advertising does and how it works,&quot; he says, there are protections against ''false, deceptive, or unfair practices.&quot;  ''We have not in any way diminished our protections,&quot; he says. ''In fact, we continue to tighten up our rules&quot; in areas like Internet marketing.</p>

<p>
Critics, Jaffe says, ''keep acting as if there are no parents. I don't know any [preteen] child who gets himself in the car and drives to the store and buys clothes. There's a parent there. If the parent really doesn't want them to have it, the word 'no' is not impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>
Many parents don't buy that line of reasoning. They say they are willing and able to say no, but they contend that profit-hungry merchandisers are making a hard job -- parenthood -- a lot harder.</p>

<p>
''It seems like every break in a television program is something to be bought,&quot; says Jeannette Dobrushkin, 39, of Arlington, the mother of three children ranging from 5 to 10. ''At this age, it's always 'Can I, can I?' And it's always something they've seen on TV. Everything is electronic, and anything that's not seems archaic.&quot;</p>

<p>
Martha Corazon, 46, of Cambridge, mother of an 8-year-old boy, acknowledges that ultimately, ''it's up to the parents&quot; to monitor what their children watch and buy. But she wonders why advertisers don't acknowledge that ''just because kids are exposed to more doesn't mean they're ready to be exposed to more.&quot;</p>

<p>
Corazon's concerns are widespread, because one effect of the upsurge in youth marketing is that the lines between childhood and adulthood are being blurred. ''Kids are being marketed to from the moment they're born,&quot; says Susan Linn, author of ''Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood.&quot;</p>

<p>
''And they're not just being marketed products, they're being marketed values,&quot; adds Linn. ''And the values are: 'Things can make me cool; things define my self-worth.' These are the messages we're sending kids all their waking hours.&quot;</p>

<p>
As kids have absorbed and acted on those messages, analysts say, family finances have been put under greater and greater stress. Various reports have estimated the average credit-card debt in US households to exceed $8,000, more than double the amount in 1990. More than one in five teenagers have their own credit cards or access to their parents', according to a report prepared by Teenage Research Unlimited.</p>

<p>
Consequently, companies that have traditionally focused on adult consumers -- car manufacturers, insurance companies, banks, credit unions, even financial planners -- are going after teenage customers with increasing vigor. Susan Landry, who is Miranda Zappala's stepmother, says what is most startling to her is how marketers pitch ''junior Martha Stewart&quot;-style home furnishings to teenagers who are presumably working for minimum wage, if at all. ''It's horrendous,&quot; she says. ''Before you can even drive, to be decorating your house, is really strange to me.&quot; Landry, 55, says that when she was in high school, ''Teenagers weren't considered to have an income. Now, teenagers are assumed to have a bottomless well of money at their disposal.&quot;</p>

<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">A preteen push</span></span>Wood, of Teenage Research Unlimited, says that ''most companies in most categories are looking to see if they have a product or a potential product for this market. Teens are forming impressions of brands at a very young age.&quot;</p>

<p>
And so are preteens.  Having conquered the teenage demographic, marketers are now training their sights on an even younger cohort: the 8- to 12-year-olds whom advertisers call ''tweens.&quot;</p>

<p>
''Tween marketing is probably the hottest thing in youth marketing,&quot; says Schor, a professor of sociology at Boston College. ''What's going on is that many of the things we used to see in the teen consumer culture -- music, fashion, makeup -- are now being marketed to this younger group. They've already been inculcated into the teen consumer scene by the time they actually become teenagers.&quot;</p>

<p>
While researching her book, Schor learned of an acronym that marketers use to justify their efforts: KAGOY, meaning ''Kids are getting older younger.&quot; Says Schor: ''The official version is that it's a social trend and they're just responding to it. In fact, if you talk privately, many of them will say they're contributing to it.&quot;</p>

<p>
The result of this trend is a phenomenon called ''age compression.&quot; For instance, whereas young girls might once have used pretend makeup, now -- thanks to advertising campaigns -- they might buy and wear real makeup. Preteens watch MTV and read magazines geared toward teenagers. And when it comes to clothing, says Schor, ''You have sexualized fashions in the 6 to 12 range for girls: bare midriffs, spaghetti straps, teensy shirts and skirts, and adult colors like black.&quot;</p>

<p>
Holly Berry, a 41-year-old child-care worker in Cambridge, has seen firsthand the impact of those ads. A couple of years ago, while watching a TV commercial for youth-oriented clothing with a 5-year-old girl in her care, Berry was startled when the child said to her: ''Holly, don't you think that's sexy? Don't you like those little belly shirts?&quot;</p>

<p>
''She sees all these girls in low-cut jeans, with their bellies showing, and she loves the clothes and wants the clothes,&quot; says Berry. ''More and more commercials are like that.&quot;</p>

<p>
According to some experts, marketers are capitalizing on a shifting balance of family power resulting from the reluctance of baby-boomer parents to assert traditional authority. ''It's a boomer thing,&quot; says Alissa Quart, author of ''Branded: The Buying and Selling of Teenagers.&quot;</p>

<p>
''The parents didn't want to be too parent-y, so it's like, 'Oh, what do <em>you </em>want? [Marketers] are trying to take advantage of somewhat fractured families and parents who don't know what their roles are.&quot;</p>

<p>
Wherever the messages come from, the point of saturation is reached well before high school, creating brand awareness and snob appeal among youngsters barely into puberty. In Duxbury, ''You don't want to come in to middle school with <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=WMT" target="_new">Wal-Mart</a> jeans and have someone ask where you got them,&quot; says Zappala. Leveraging that sort of peer pressure, companies often resort to what is called ''stealth marketing&quot; or ''peer-to-peer marketing,&quot; in which they enlist teenagers to market to teenagers. For instance, Garces, of Newton, says salespeople at music and clothing stores have tried to give her advertising stickers when she purchases something. ''They say, 'Hang this around your school locker and advertise for us. Put it on your books and show them to your friends. Send them to us,' &quot; she says.</p>

<p>
Mindful of how much time young people spend online, marketers are also making their pitches on the Internet, as well as through such traditional venues as television, magazines, and billboards. ''People are so concerned about pornography on the Internet, but they really need to be concerned about marketing on the Internet,&quot; says Linn. ''Where in teenagers' lives are they free from marketing? It's certainly not in school, and not at home either.&quot;</p>

<p>
Yet amid the gloom, some discern a silver lining: Namely, the growth of what Quart calls ''the consumer rights of children.&quot; Quart says teens can feel empowered if their input is sought in deciding what family car to buy. ''It's not entirely a negative thing, because kids can be infantilized in a bad way, in being excluded from all the decision-making,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>
Moreover, some of today's media-savvy kids are able to tune out the marketing noise. Both Zappala and Garces say that despite such relentless marketing pressure, they refuse to surrender to commercialism. Zappala,  now on the cusp of college, says she would rather spend her money on higher education than on trendy bags or boots. As for Garces: ''I'm numb to the advertising,&quot; she says. ''I see so much advertising it doesn't faze me. I've been watching TV a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>
Besides, after a trip to Nicaragua last year, where she and seven other students helped build schools in poor villages, she finds the rampant consumerism of Americans of all ages even harder to understand.</p>

<p>
''They had no TVs, no bathrooms, not much running water, very little of what we think of as the usual accommodations,&quot; says Garces. ''When I came back, the idea of buying more than one pair of jeans seemed ridiculous. There, people aren't worrying about, 'What am I going to buy at the mall?' They're thinking, 'How am I going to eat?' &quot;</p>
