                                <span><p>It&#8217;s hard not to be a little jealous of Simon Goldhill, a classics professor at King&#8217;s College, Cambridge, given the suggestion his book editor made to him. &#8220;Make a pilgrimage,&#8217;&#8217; his editor offered. &#8220;Go anywhere and write about it.&#8217;&#8217; Inspired by Goldhill&#8217;s recent interest in the 19th-century intellectual landscape, the two decided that Goldhill should complete a 21st-century version of a Victorian fad among British and American Protestants: making pilgrimages to the homes of famous authors.</p><p>Goldhill is somewhat skeptical of these sorts of pilgrimages, but his is a playful, open-minded sort of skepticism. So off he goes to visit the former homes of Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, the Bront&#235; sisters, and Shakespeare, as well as Freud&#8217;s one-time office (all of which are in the United Kingdom). &#8220;The plan was to journey as much as possible by Victorian means and following Victorian guidebooks,&#8217;&#8217; he writes (a plan that sometimes proved difficult to stick to).</p><p>The result is a series of essay-like travelogue entries ruminating on the different sites, the histories behind them and their occupants, and what it all means - or doesn&#8217;t. In the hands of a more wide-eyed and credulous author, this could have quickly become tiresome for those of us who aren&#8217;t well-versed in the works and biographies of these titans.</p><p>Luckily for the reader, Goldhill isn&#8217;t one to stand in front of some faded personal effect from a long-dead literary legend and weep with joy at the meaningfulness of the moment. Rather, he writes smartly and convincingly about all the questions posed by the fact that countless people breathlessly visit these writers&#8217; former homes, which have become tourist traps to various extents. A recurrent theme is that these places aren&#8217;t in anything like their original forms, and yet the visitors to them - not to mention the organizations that run the tours - seem to feed off the &#8220;authenticity&#8217;&#8217; of the experience. At the Bront&#235; parsonage, which has been upgraded and renovated and restored several times over the years, Goldhill was reminded of some of his earlier travels: &#8220;I have spent a lot of time in Jerusalem at sites of religious pilgrimage that are not only back-constructions but back-constructions of things that have never happened and certainly didn&#8217;t happen there&#8230; . Haworth isn&#8217;t quite like the Stations of the Cross, but it is worth asking why it continues to have such a pull on the imagination.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p>&#8220;Freud&#8217;s Couch, Scott&#8217;s Buttocks, Bront&#235;&#8217;s Grave&#8217;&#8217; is a short book, easily read in an evening or two, and it&#8217;s peppered with amusing observations. At one point, Goldhill writes about the cultural differences in train conduct between Brits and Americans: &#8220;Dickens, for all his love of characters and encounters, was horrified by the intimacy of American travel,&#8217;&#8217; he writes. &#8220;Americans, in turn, were baffled by the starched formality of the British at close quarters. For American and British Victorian travelers, making their pilgrimages to writers&#8217; houses, culture clash began the moment they stepped onto the train.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p>Goldhill also occasionally slips into a good-natured curmudgeonliness, as when he reflects on the lost art of walking around: &#8220;The lengthy walk, veined with serious conversation, dotted with observation of the world around, interrupted by meetings with strangers, punctuated by unreliable hostelries, is no longer with us as a necessary and familiar part of life,&#8217;&#8217; he laments.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard not to agree with this sentiment, old-fashioned as it may seem, and it&#8217;s also hard not to smile at the prospect of spending a day walking around with the author of this short, winning book.</p><p><em class="i"><em class="i">Jesse Singal is a frequent contributor to the Globe.
