<article_body><p><strong>Arnie & Jack: Palmer, Nicklaus,<br> and Golf&#146;s Greatest Rivalry</strong><br>By Ian O&#146;Connor<br> <em>Houghton Mifflin, 354 pp., $26</em></p>
<p>In today's golf world, Tiger Woods remains the undisputed king of the links, despite occasional attempts by the sports media to drum up rivalries between Woods and opponents like Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, or Sergio Garcia.</p>
<p>Sports journalist Ian O'Connor takes an in-depth look at the greatest rivalry golf has ever seen, between Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. While O'Connor's book is hardly as dramatic as a Sunday showdown between these two legends, it does make an undeniable case that the Palmer-Nicklaus rivalry motivated both golfers to achieve greatness. Palmer was older, from the tougher background of working-class Latrobe, Pa., and among the most charismatic, beloved athletes in history. Nicklaus was a decade younger, more internally driven, and less sociable.</p>
<p>Palmer changed golf forever by becoming its first television superstar in the late 1950s, making more money pitching products than winning tournaments. Followed around courses by his adoring fans (Arnie's Army), Palmer "was the Marlboro Man chain-smoking L &amp; Ms. He was a clean cut Elvis whose contortions were deemed appropriate for all viewing audiences." Palmer was a risk taker who attacked golf courses, consistently getting into and out of trouble. Among his legions of fans were presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Palmer would dominate golf until an upstart from Columbus, Ohio, named Jack Nicklaus challenged him in the early 1960s. Nicklaus played slowly and carefully, taking minutes to consider each shot. Palmer "made eye contact with everyone; Nicklaus made eye contact only with the pin." They had different golfing styles and different personalities. Most of all, Palmer and Nicklaus each wanted to be alone atop the golfing world.</p>
<p>At the 1960 US Open, young Nicklaus took the early lead, but Palmer made a dramatic, crowd-pleasing Sunday comeback, taking control and winning by making birdies on six of the first seven holes. At the 1962 US Open, these two bitter rivals were tied with five holes to go. Arnie's Army mercilessly assaulted Nicklaus with catcalls about his weight (calling him "Fat Jack" and "Ohio fats"), while cheering Palmer's every move. In a dramatic playoff, Nicklaus ignored the abuse and defeated Palmer to win his first US Open.</p>
<p>In 1963, Nicklaus won his first Masters, but Palmer won it in 1964. The fans and media continued to view Nicklaus as the colorless bad guy: "He was trying to tear down the most popular player of all time," explains O'Connor, and being the heavy bothered Nicklaus. Yet he continued to let his golf game do his talking. After Nicklaus won the 1965 Masters, his image among the fans began to improve. Meanwhile, Palmer was losing his winning touch. In the 1966 US Open, Palmer gave away a seven-shot lead and then lost a playoff.</p>
<p>After the late 1960s, Nicklaus would dominate Palmer, though Palmer occasionally challenged. At the 1972 US Open, won by Nicklaus, Palmer made a furious charge: "on the  second day Palmer came raging out of the past like an old lawman barreling through the swinging doors of a saloon." Although O'Connor's description is somewhat over the top, the gunslinger Nicklaus survived this shootout.</p>
<p>O'Connor belabors the rivalry a bit, describing how Nicklaus and Palmer competed passionately for endorsements (Palmer was the clear winner) and contracts to design new golf courses (Nicklaus dominated). O'Connor interviewed both Nicklaus and Palmer for this book, but they offer few unkind words about each other. From a golf fan's perspective, the end result of this legendary rivalry is clear. Jack Nicklaus was the greater golfer, while Palmer was the more popular and charismatic.</p>
