<strong>THE STORY SO FAR: </strong><em>It is 1803, and as the French Emperor Napoleon conquers much of Europe, people in England fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father packs up his family and moves north to Scotland. A man on horseback, calling himself ''the fox," tells the family to go to the Headless Piper inn in the village of Glenard. There, the innkeeper, Mr. Campbell, tends to Jim's father, who has become quite ill. Jim's mother goes back to England, but Jim stays at the inn to work for Mr. Campbell. Jim explores the village but is frightened by strange sounds coming from the dunes, called the Culbin Sands, and by the stories Mr. Campbell tells about the ghosts of drowned sailors who often come to the inn at night. He also says the Culbin Sands once covered a huge mansion owned by a baron, who was thought to be a smuggler. One morning, a wrecked ship, thought to be French, washes up on the beach, empty and with no sign of the sailors. A day or so later, Jim's father says he heard someone in the cellar. Jim investigates but finds only Mr. Campbell, mopping the floor of a small room. Mr. Campbell then does two things that Jim finds strange: He asks Jim to clean a perfectly clean and unused chimney, and he takes a lantern to the beach, flashes some signals at a far-off ship, and watches the ship turn and sail away.</em></p><table

<span class="tagline"><span class="tagline"/></span></p>

<p>
We spent the long winter in Glenard. We had a very snowy, but merry Christmas, and rang in the new year in a blizzard. Then, months later, springtime began to brighten the Highlands, and my father slowly found his health again.</p>

<p>
The color returned to his face, and he started rising from his bed to stare for hours from his window, out across the Firth. He took only one turn for the worse, suddenly, on a pleasant evening. He shouted for me, and I hurried to his room to find him as pale as a candle. He was at his window, in the moment of sunset.</p>

<p>
''Look, Jim!" he cried. ''There's a great serpent out there, huffing and puffing." I looked, and saw nothing.</p>

<p>
''It's gone under water," he said. ''Wait and you'll see. It breathes smoke, and it thrashes the water." But of course I waited in vain, and then Father went back to his bed for two solid days.</p>

<p>
In April he began to strengthen his legs by taking the air in the village. He liked very much when I swept the chimneys, for then he would stand with Mr. Campbell and call out that he could see the brush sparkling at the rooftops. I performed that peculiar task most often at dusk and at dawn.</p>

<p>
As the snow melted in the hills, more visitors came to the inn. Mysterious men who arrived in the dark, they were invariably skulking and silent. They passed a day without leaving their rooms, then vanished again the next night. And when they'd gone, I often found that the sign of the Piper needed straightening again, for it had somehow fallen crooked in its chains.</p>

<p>
But I never complained, for I liked Mr. Campbell a great deal. He took me out on his Preventive rides, and once or twice a week he taught me fencing. Up and down the parlor, we parried and thrusted with our foils, and he scored hits on me one after another. ''You're quite the swordsman, Jim," he said one morning, when our session left him breathless. ''You'll be more than a match for me soon."</p>

<p>
Those would have been the happiest days of my life, if not for a nagging fear that they would end. I dreaded the day my father would recover and take me home to England. It was rather wicked of me, but I sometimes told him, ''Father, you don't look well," and so encouraged him to return to his bed. I did this especially on the nights when Strawberry Nose and the McDonalds gathered at the Headless Piper, for I wished somewhat selfishly to pass those times without him. The fishermen never failed anymore to nudge a chair and tell me to ''haul alongside."</p>

<p>
It was a night in May when Strawberry Nose called for a glass of small beer and placed it by my elbow. I felt that the gesture made me at once a part of the gathering, and a part of the village as well. I hoisted my glass high, calling out at the top of my lungs, ''Confusion to the French!"</p>

<p>
In my mind, it was the very proper toast, but it brought a dreadful silence to the parlor. Mr. Campbell gaped at me from the bar, and I sat like a statue, with my arm in the air.</p>

<p>
''Did I say something wrong?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Not at all," said Mr. Campbell. And then, ''Well, dash it, Jim, you're a Sassenach."</p>

<p>
''What's that?" said I.</p>

<p>
''Och!" cried one-eyed John Donald McDonald. ''It's a bloody murderer who kills women and children in their beds."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell snorted. ''Come along now. A Sassenach is only someone from south of the border."</p>

<p>
''Ye're one yourself, Campbell!" said Donald John McDonald.</p>

<p>
''I am," agreed Mr. Campbell. ''You see, Jim, the Scots don't fear Napoleon like we do. It's England that Boney's after. It's the King he's fighting."</p>

<p>
''One tyrant for another!" cried John Donald McDonald. ''It was the Sassenachs what murdered my old granda."</p>

<p>
''Och, get awa! It was the drink," shouted Strawberry Nose.</p>

<p>
''Aye. The English gin!" said John Donald McDonald fiercely.</p>

<p>
''Say what you like," said Mr. Campbell. ''But the English don't frighten Boney. It's not fear or confusion that's keeping the Frenchies at bay, Jim. It's gold, or rather the lack of it."</p>

<p>
''What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''The day Emperor Napoleon can pay for his ships and his armies, that's the day he'll come," said he. ''One morning he'll land, and by midnight England will fall."</p>

<p>
''Och, what rubbish!" shouted Donald John McDonald.</p>

<p>
I was sorry that I had started this argument. I got up and left the men to it, abandoning my still-full glass. It would be my chore, at any rate, to clean the table when the fishermen finally rolled themselves out to the street.</p>

<p>
I walked through Glenard, feeling a wind rising from the sea. The last few nights had been so stormy that I'd heard the wailing from the Culbin Sands, and it seemed another gale was brewing. The last had brought one of Mr. Campbell's sailor ghosts, with a sudden tapping on the inn at midnight. I had heard him being led to the cellar, but hadn't seen him, for he'd faded away by morning.</p>

<p>
Round by the harbor, I circled the village. I was coming close to the Piper again when my father came running through its door, shouting my name in the street. Mr. Campbell came behind him, in his apron stained with whisky.</p>

<p>
''You're sickly, sir," shouted Campbell.</p>

<p>
''I'm not!" cried Father. ''Jim, where are you?"</p>

<p>
''Here," said I, and ran to meet him.</p>

<p>
''Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim," said Mr. Campbell. ''Your father's taken another turn."</p>

<p>
''I haven't!" said Father. He tried to shake off the hand that Mr. Campbell had closed on his arm. ''Jim, I saw a ship out there. A sinking ship. You believe me, don't you, Jim? I saw the masts topple, and down it went."</p>

<p>
''Here, you're too distraught," said Mr. Campbell. ''You must get back to bed."</p>

<p>
''Yes," said Father. ''Yes, all right. But, Jim, please go and look. See if there isn't a ship in peril."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell nodded at me, and off I went. I ran toward the beach, then thought I'd ride old Ready instead, and veered toward the stable.</p>

<p>
The wind was rising by the minute. I found the stable shaking in the gusts, its boards banging. Inside, Mr. Campbell's black mare was shrieking and kicking. She had battered so hard at the back of her stall that the boards were flapping back and forth as though on hinges. Now I watched her rear up and smash the gate to splinters. She bolted from the stable, fleeing into the night.</p>

<p>
But the boards kept swinging back and forth, which I thought was very strange. When I looked closely I saw that they <em>were</em> on hinges. A secret door was fitted into the stable wall, and a tunnel stretched beyond it.</p>

<p>
Well, a secret passage was too much for a boy to pass by. Without a thought I parted the doors and crawled through the tunnel.</p>

<p>
It was fearfully dark, of course, but I saw right away a crack of light at its end. I crawled toward it, and soon found myself staring into the little room in the Piper's cellar, through the hinged end of one of the wooden crates. Sitting sideways to me was a man in a hooded coat, his face completely hidden. I had no doubt it was a man and not a ghost, for he was busily filling a pipe.</p>

<p>
I heard Mr. Campbell's voice. He was there in the room, beyond my view. ''You've twice escaped, you can do it once more," he said, rather testily.</p>

<p>
The hooded man answered in a burst of French.</p>

<p>
''The boy is poking about," said Mr. Campbell. ''But he won't be any bother. I'll see to that myself."</p>

<p>
He began to leave the room, taking the light with him. From the doorway he called out in a clear voice, ''Vive la France!"</p>

<p>
Well, how my heart pounded! I felt betrayed and stupid and frightened all at once. Mr. Campbell wasn't comforting spirits in the cellar of the Piper. He was spiriting Frenchmen in and out of Britain, for it all made sense to me then.</p>

<p>
The gruesome sign of the skeletal piper must have served as a signal whenever it hung askew. The chimney brush, I imagined, flashed signals to French ships lurking in the Firth. I wagered that there had never been a ghost of any sort, and that all the tales of specters had been told to keep me safely frightened</p>

<p>
The room and the tunnel darkened completely as Mr. Campbell left the cellar. I heard the Frenchman strike a match, and the glow as he lit his pipe was all that led me back along the tunnel.</p>

<p>
I wasn't brave enough to tackle Mr. Campbell on his own. But I thought I might play his little game against him, and quickly turn the tables. I found his lantern with its signaling spout, and rode Ready Aye Ready along the beach toward the Sands.</p>

<p>
Over Ready's silver head, between his ears, I aimed the lantern spout. It made a shining beam in the blowing spray and sand, an oval of light on the beach. The poor, stupid beast hurried along, as though trying to catch that spot.</p>

<p>
I hadn't ridden very far when something shimmered in that moving light. It flashed ahead, then swept darkly below me. There was another flash a few moments later, and this time I stopped old Ready and stepped him backward.</p>

<p>
There was a coin, a doubloon, placed very neatly in the white bowl of a cockleshell.</p>

<p>
I found another, and another, a whole trail of golden coins. Then I lifted my lantern, and its spot of light fell on Daft Willy.</p>

<p>
It had been many months since his disappearance, but he was very much alive. I caught him in the light just as he stooped to place a coin on the green ball of a stranded kelp. His box was open at his side, and I saw that it nearly overflowed with polished coins.</p>

<p>
He looked up, into my light, and raised a hand against its glare.</p>

<p>
''What are you doing, Willy?" I said. ''Where have you been all this time?"</p>

<p>
''In the Sands," said he. ''Doon in the Sands wi' the crab men. The serpent's there too."</p>

<p>
He grinned his fool's grin, with the wind tearing at his hair and clothes. Then he burst out into a string of phrases, all in French, and all in a high voice so that he was like a mad, chattering parrot. ''Merci bien," he said.''Il fait bon chez soi. Je rentre au foyer."</p>

<p>
Daft Willy picked up his box then, and headed up into the Culbin Sands. I tried to follow him, but Ready refused to climb the dune. More stubborn than ever, he planted his hooves and didn't even flinch when I kicked him.</p>

<p>
My lantern showed a brief glimpse of Daft Willy passing over the top of the dune, and I followed him on foot.</p>

<p>
He led me up and down as the shifting sands whirled in the wind, hiding his footprints and hiding my own. I heard the terrible wail of the voices, that deathly howl that raised my hair and prickled my arms.</p>

<p>
But on I went.</p>
