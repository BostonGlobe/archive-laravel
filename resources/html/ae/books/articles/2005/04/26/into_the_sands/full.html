THE STORY SO FAR: <em>It is 1803, and as the French Emperor Napoleon conquers much of Europe, people in England fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father moves his family north to Scotland. A man calling himself ''</em><em>The </em><em><em>Fox" tells the family to go to the Headless Piper inn in the village of Glenard. There, the innkeeper, Mr. Campbell, tends to Jim's father, who has become quite ill. Jim's mother goes back to England, and Jim stays at the inn to work for Mr. Campbell. Jim explores the village but is frightened by strange sounds coming from the dunes, called the Culbin Sands, and by the stories Mr. Campbell tells about the ghosts of drowned sailors who often come to the inn at night. Then, strange things start to happen. One morning, a wrecked ship, thought to be French, washes up on the beach, empty and with no sign of the sailors. A day or so later, Mr. Campbell asks Jim to brush out a perfectly clean and unused chimney, and then takes a lantern to the beach, flashes some signals at a far-off ship, and watches the ship turn and sail away. The ''Headless Piper" sign on the door of the inn frequently becomes crooked for no apparent reason. Then Jim discovers a secret tunnel leading from the stable to a room in the basement of the inn, where he hears a man speaking in French and starts to think Mr. Campbell is actually helping the French. Later that night, Jim goes to the beach and follows a man named Daft Willy up into the dark and scary Culbin Sands.</em></em></p><table

<p>
In the dark of night, on the shifting sands, I lost track of Daft Willy. He disappeared among the great dunes, with the voices shrieking in the storm.</p>

<p>
I flashed my lantern back and forth as I stumbled up the dunes. At last its light fell across a dark shape, a twisted chimney rising from the sand.</p>

<p>
This was the source of all the voices. The shrieks were the cries of the wind round the mortared stone, the howl its whistle across the open top. I had no doubt that I had found Daft Willy's passage into the buried mansion.</p>

<p>
When I climbed to the top, though, I found the wide flue all but choked with sand. Then it shifted under my weight, and I dropped my lantern in alarm. The sand collapsed, and I plummeted down the chimney, through spider webs and brittle birds' nests, through a great fireplace, into a room that was carpeted with sand.</p>

<p>
A thick plank fell out beside me. It must have been a plug set into the chimney, for a strong wind now gusted up the flue, snatching sand from the floor, and the voices of the dunes were no longer a shriek, but a deep and terrible moan.</p>

<p>
The flame of a single lamp leapt in the wind, showing vast counters and iron basins, and butcher's blocks and ovens. Every inch of every surface was dusted with sand. The floor was covered three-feet deep around the fireplace, and perhaps six inches at the distant door.</p>

<p>
I got up and wandered through the mansion.</p>

<p>
In the next room was the longest table I'd ever seen, with chairs three-score in number. I saw a suit of armor toppled in a corner, and a stag's head staring from a wall. I walked through bed chambers and dressing rooms, from one pool of light to another, always on a carpet of sand. Every window was shuttered, and the shutters bulged inward, leaking sand through their cracks onto massive cones as high as the sills. Tapestries hung in tatters. Bed sheets looked like fields of mushrooms.</p>

<p>
I came to the top of a grand staircase, its stone steps descending like a waterfall. Below a pair of crossed rapiers, in a high-backed chair, sat a skeleton.</p>

<p>
Spiders had made their home in the man's ribs, and rats in his skull. His clothes had fallen away in shreds, but he still wore a golden ring that looked huge around his fleshless finger.</p>

<p>
I guessed this was the baron, and that he had sat himself here in his last minutes, to stare forever down his staircase, at a hall so splendid that the chandeliers still glittered, and the many rows of armor stood like faithful knights.</p>

<p>
I could hear many people moving down there, and the sound of water flowing, and a constant thump and whoosh that gave the mansion heartbeats and a breath.</p>

<p>
I crept down the grand stairs, through the hall and down again, by way of a narrow staircase.</p>

<p>
Everything that Mr. Campbell had told me about the Culbin Sands was in my mind just then. I saw that he had tried to fill me with fear of the place, to ensure that I would never stand where I was standing right then.</p>

<p>
The men below me were speaking French. Their voices became louder as the stairs turned. Through one more passage, I came to a tremendous room in the cellar of the mansion, lit by scores of lamps. In its middle was a gigantic stone trough full of seawater. The tide flowed freely through a brick-lined tunnel so wide that a carriage could have driven through it. Around the trough were towering stacks of coins and gold bars.</p>

<p>
The men wore the uniforms of French sailors. Some pumped huge bellows, producing the airy, thumping sound of heartbeats. Others turned a great spit, reeling onto its drum a thick cable that fed from the tunnel.</p>

<p>
Everything that I saw made sense of something I had learned before. The French ship that had washed ashore without a soul aboard -- well, here was its crew. The tales of a smuggling baron -- I was looking at his passage to the sea.</p>

<p>
I took it all in from the shadows of the passage. But of Daft Willy I saw no sign.</p>

<p>
As I stood there, the sea began to churn at the mouth of the tunnel. Out of its darkness, up from the sea, came three strange creatures. They were Daft Willy's crab-men, walking upright on the sloping floor of the trough. They had round heads and thick arms, and their bodies were encased in glistening shells. Each carried a leather bag on its back.</p>

<p>
The sailors swarmed around the creatures, and it seemed they were tearing them apart. A head snapped off; an arm went flying, and one of the beetle-like shells collapsed on the floor. Then, from the three casings, stepped three men.</p>

<p>
Their shells were diving contraptions, the round heads their helmets, all made of leather and canvas. From the bags they had carried came lumps of stone and sea sponge. In minutes, with hammer and file, the Frenchmen converted those lumps to shining coins, stripping away the mud and growth that covered them.</p>

<p>
Now it all made sense. The French were salvaging riches from the galleons that had wrecked in the Firth. It seemed their task was nearly done, that every box and chest had been filled.</p>

<p>
Just then, with a wheeze and a puff, and a cough of smoke, came the thing to take them away.</p>

<p>
''The serpent was there," Daft Willy had said.</p>

<p>
The sailors cranked the cable onto the drum. Out from the tunnel came Willy's serpent, with an iron spike for a nose, and iron plates on its back. There were little round windows fitted like eyes, and fins sticking out from the sides. For a heart, it had a steam engine, and that began to thump away as the hull emerged from the tunnel.</p>

<p>
Smoke swirled through the opening. This huge undersea vessel came crawling through it, thumping and clanging. It had three hinged masts that now lay flat along the deck.</p>

<p>
I could imagine what it was like on the surface. Someone seeing its masts folding down would think of a ship rolling over. Steaming on the surface, it would look like a serpent with smoky breath, its nose piercing the waves.</p>

<p>
I thought of my poor father and his distress at the sight from his window. I wished that I had really listened to all I had been told, that I had opened my eyes to the things I had seen.</p>

<p>
When the undersea vessel was drawn up in the trough, the engine shut down. Only wisps of steam rose from vents and hidden funnels. Then hatches came open, and out stepped the captain.</p>

<p>
''Vive la France!" he shouted.</p>

<p>
All the sailors in the room answered with one booming voice: ''Vive la France! Vive Napoleon!"</p>

<p>
The captain was followed by a man in a hood, the same fellow I had seen in the Headless Piper. On the heels of the hooded man came Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>
There was a good 60 yards between him and me, but it seemed that his head turned straight toward me. I drew back into the passage.</p>

<p>
''Come along, my good man," I heard him say. ''You won't believe where I've brought you, nor the deeds that are done here. Come and meet the baron."</p>

<p>
He said this last with a small laugh, and I imagined how he would laugh again as he introduced the hooded man to the skeleton in its chair.</p>

<p>
A gangway was placed against the undersea vessel, and the two came down it.</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell spoke in perfect French. ''Embarquez l'or," he said. Load the gold. ''Faites cacher les coffres et les caisses. D&#xE9;p&#xEA;chez-vous, les gars." Hide the chests and the crates. Hurry up, lads!</p>

<p>
He told them, ''The squadron is waiting," then shouted in great spirit, ''vive la France!"</p>

<p>
I abandoned any hope of stopping him. It would be all I could do to save myself.</p>

<p>
I retreated up the steps, through the hall and up again. In the middle of the grand staircase, I stopped and listened. The mansion now seemed deathly quiet, all sealed in its tomb of sand. There was no moan of wind, no shriek of voices.</p>

<p>
The chimney had been sealed again! I was trapped in the mansion.</p>

<p>
My first thought, upon this realization, was to hide myself and wait for the French to leave. There was no end of rooms, no possibility that anyone would search them. I could wait as long as I pleased and . . .</p>

<p>
Wait for what? To be left alone in the Sands?</p>

<p>
One by one, the lamps would go out, leaving me in utter blackness, with my only company a skeleton, and the terrors all around.</p>

<p>
I could hear Mr. Campbell coming now, he and the hooded man.</p>

<p>
I hurried to the landing and flung the bones of the baron from his chair, scattering ribs and skull, spiders and rats. I stepped to the seat, up to the back. I snatched one of the rapiers from the wall and tested its balance as Mr. Campbell had taught me. Then I took the baron's place, sitting in his mortal dust.</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell showed no surprise.</p>

<p>
''Why, hello," he said, as casually as he'd ever greeted me.</p>

<p>
The hooded man stopped below him. I rose from the chair, producing my sword with something of a flourish. It pleased me to see a glimmer of shock now in Mr. Campbell's eyes.</p>

<p>
''Easy, lad," he said. ''You don't know the half of it."</p>

<p>
''I know enough," said I. ''Did it please you to see me sending your signals to the French?"</p>

<p>
''Now, Jim," said he, backing away. ''You're not the swordsman that you think you are."</p>

<p>
I took a step forward for each one he took backward. He reached the top of the stairs and nearly stumbled down them, his arms wheeling to catch his balance. In a flash, the hooded man was beside him. He reached in his jacket and -- with a whisper of steel -- drew out a long dagger. He cried, ''En garde!"</p>

<p>
I took the fencer's stance.</p>

<p>
''Jim, he'll run you through," shouted Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>
The hooded man came at me. Our blades clanged and clashed. Then I parried his thrust and attacked. I lunged and stepped, lunged and stepped again. His dagger whistled in wide sweeps and slashes, then locked with mine, guard to guard. With a twist of my wrist I sent his blade spinning from his hand, and it clattered across the stones.</p>

<p>
With one motion, he ripped his jacket open and bared his heart, for he had lost quite fairly, and was nothing if not gallant.</p>

<p>
With a flick of the rapier, I tore back his hood. I gasped. He was the rider from the hills, the man who had given me help in an hour of need.</p>

<p>
''Who <em>are</em> you?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''La Fosse," he said, with a small bow. ''Martine La Fosse. ''Je suis au service de Napol&#xE9;on." I serve Napoleon.</p>

<p>
I nearly laughed. I had thought of him all this time as The Fox. I lowered my sword as I smiled at the joke.</p>

<p>
''You mock me," he said, in English.</p>

<p>
''No," said I.</p>

<p>
''How dare you, young cur?"</p>

<p>
He was faster than a snake. He cuffed me aside, leapt to the baron's chair, and leapt down with the other rapier. En garde!" he cried again. And now he came in a blur, his sword swishing. I barely parried it aside, then retreated to the stairs.</p>

<p>
He was there nearly before me. He feinted, then lunged, and down the stairs we went.</p>

<p>
The Frenchman took a nick from my sleeve. ''I teach you what it means to laugh at La Fosse," he said.</p>

<p>
He drove me before him, across the hall with our blades clashing, into the stairwell and down the narrow steps. He was smiling, his eyes bright with pleasure.</p></div>
