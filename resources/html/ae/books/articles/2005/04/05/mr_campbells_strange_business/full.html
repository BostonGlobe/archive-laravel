<strong>THE STORY SO FAR: </strong><i>It is 1803, and as the French Emperor Napoleon conquers much of Europe, people in England fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father packs up his family and moves north to Scotland. A man on horseback, calling himself ''the fox," tells the family to go to the Headless Piper inn. There, the innkeeper, Mr. Campbell, tends to Jim's father, who has become quite ill. Jim explores the village but is frightened by strange sounds coming from the dunes, called the Culbin Sands, and by the sight of a man walking toward him. Jim's mother goes back to England, but Jim stays at the inn to work for Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell tells Jim about a shipwreck years ago, and the ghosts of the drowned sailors who often come to the inn at night. He also says the Culbin  Sands once blew and covered a huge mansion owned by a baron, who was thought to be a smuggler. The baron, his farm workers, and their families were buried alive. One night, the mother of Daft Willy, a young man in the village, tells Mr. Campbell her son is missing. Jim walks over the dunes looking for him and sees a hole filling with sand. The next morning, a wrecked ship, thought to be French, washes up on the beach. It is empty, with no sign of the sailors. Back at the inn, Jim's father says he is sure he heard someone in the cellar. Jim goes to investigate.</i></p><table

<p>
The cellar of the Headless Piper was a dark and chilly place. I went into it slowly, holding forth my lamp.</p>

<p>
Only one other door led to the place. The entrance for the draymen with their barrels of beer, it faced the street, and I knew it to be kept not only bolted, but heavily latched and locked as well, for it had a tendency to bang in the wind.</p>

<p>
''Jim, be careful!" cried my father in his room. His voice was so muffled that he must have been biting his blankets.</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the steps was the row of barrels that fed Mr. Campbell's beer engine. From the shadows between them a movement caught my eye, and I turned toward it. Then, from another corner, came a hissing and a rustle, and when I whirled again to look, a shape leaped out from the blackness. It gave me a fair start, until I saw that the cellar seethed with rats.</p>

<p>
I had to force myself to go on, around the base of the massive stone chimney, through an archway of timbers, into the space below the parlor.</p>

<p>
It surprised me to find a gleam of light from the other side, shining through the crack where a small door was ajar. From there came the rustling sounds.</p>

<p>
''Hello!" I shouted. ''Who's down here?"</p>

<p>
The door opened wider. I saw Mr. Campbell standing in the light with a mop in his hand. ''Jim?" he said. ''Is that you?"</p>

<p>
I walked toward him, annoyed that I'd been sent on a goose chase. ''My father thought you were a Frenchman," I said.</p>

<p>
''Did he?" Mr. Campbell laughed. ''Why, you're quite a pair, the two of you."</p>

<p>
He stepped aside to let me into the room. It was quite small and low-roofed, with a floor of ancient flagstones that Mr. Campbell had just finished mopping. The wet wood shone in the light from our lamps. On the beams above were the marks of adze and chisel, and in the corners hung spider webs as thick as quilts. Piled against one wall were old wooden crates that might have sat unmoved for 100 years.</p>

<p>
''You want to see ghosts, Jim? Here's where you'll find them," said Mr. Campbell. ''It's the oldest part of the inn. Can you hear the weeping?"</p>

<p>
''No," I said.</p>

<p>
''Listen."</p>

<p>
I could hear the rats in the far room, and then my father's throaty coughs came through the floor from right above us. Mr. Campbell smiled. ''Ah," said he. ''We'll have to shift him from there. No sense in having him jump and twitch at every sound."</p>

<p>
I looked once more around the room. I thought I'd seen it all, but in a corner, on the wall, was the smeared mark of a palm and fingers.</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell saw me looking, then applied his mop and scrubbed away the stain. ''I can't keep up with them," he said. ''No sooner do I scrub than hand prints appear again."</p>

<p>
''Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''When the English won at Culloden, they went on a rampage," Mr. Campbell said. ''They rode through the villages, killing everyone they met. In this very room they found three women and seven children, and murdered them all. You really can't hear their cries?"</p>

<p>
''No, sir," I said.</p>

<p>
''But you see where the English sabers scored the wood, do you?" He touched the beams. ''How the blades must have flashed and clanged in here. How the children must have screamed."</p>

<p>
He shivered dramatically. ''Well, that's enough for me. Come along, Jim. There's work to do."</p>

<p>
''Yes," I said. ''I meant to straighten the sign at the door."</p>

<p>
''Good. That's on the list," said he.</p>

<p>
''I was looking for a ladder."</p>

<p>
''Oh, you won't find one here," said Mr. Campbell. ''But I believe there's a tea chest by the parlor door that will serve the same purpose. Now, before you do that, will you nip round to the stable and see to my horse?</p>

<p>
It was a fair distance around the inn and down the slope to that old wooden building. Ready Aye Ready whinnied happily to see me, but the black mare -- always skittish -- pranced away. I found her covered in sweat, and knew that Mr. Campbell had ridden her hard. So I watered her first, then combed her as she ate, thinking how fond I was growing of the inn and its keeper, and of the village itself.</p>

<p>
By the time I finished, Mr. Campbell had already straightened the sign of the dancing, headless piper. He had also moved my father to an upstairs room, and was waiting at the landing with a wiry brush for cleaning chimneys, its metal still new and shiny.</p>

<p>
As I've said, the Headless Piper boasted four chimneys. But the one I swept that evening couldn't have been used for many a year. Not a scrap of soot fell down as I worked the brush higher up the flue, pushing the handle in through the fireplace. Mr. Campbell helped me get it all in order, then dashed out to the street to watch for the brush bursting from the chimney top. I could feel when it popped clear, but still he had me push it higher. ''Up! Up!" he shouted. Then, ''Down now, Jim!" and ''Up again!"</p>

<p>
The grandfather clock in the hall was just then striking four. ''Right! Now smartly, Jim. Pull it down!" he shouted, as the last stroke of the bells quavered into silence. The brush came out just as clean and sparkly as when I'd pushed it in.</p>

<p>
The rest of my chores were small and menial, but I applied myself to them happily the next day, and the next. I was settling into my routine, and was performing those same chores no less cheerfully a week later, when the moon was full. Mr. Campbell came to me and said, ''When you've finished there, will you get the horses ready, Jim? We'll be going for a ride, you and I. I believe there's a saddle that will fit that old charger of yours."</p>

<p>
I was eager to go, though it wasn't the most agreeable night to be out on horseback. The full moon, after a sunny day, was bound to make for a most chilly outing. By the time we left, there was a bitter wind blowing from the sea, and frost on the streets of Glenard. I didn't know why an innkeeper would have to venture out on a night that would freeze him to his horse.</p>

<p>
But Mr. Campbell, as I learned only then, was more than an innkeeper. He was the Preventiveman as well, watching over the stretch of coast from Glenard round the Culbin Sands. For him, a full-moon night was the <em>very </em>night for riding. Yet he took no weapon, which surprised me, only a strange lantern that looked much like a teakettle with an enormous spout.</p>

<p>
Where I had come from, in the south of England, I wouldn't have gone riding in the full moon for love nor money. The smugglers there were a dangerous lot, and many a traveler had been found in the morning with his head cracked open. I didn't fancy meeting any free traders in the loneliness of the Culbin Sands.</p>

<p>
''Is there much of the trade done here, Mr. Campbell?" I asked, as we rode to the east. I tried to sound fearless, but he saw right through me.</p>

<p>
''Now, don't worry, Jim," he said. ''I haven't had any trouble yet with freebooters. Look sharp and play their game, and that's enough."</p>

<p>
Poor old Ready was hard pressed to keep up with the black mare. He didn't like a saddle on his back, and showed his displeasure by trying to nip my legs. But I soon caught on to his tricks, and with a firm hand on the reins I kept him wheezing along the beach.</p>

<p>
We passed the French ship, stranded again by the ebb. Over the past few nights, every man and child from the village had begun to pull it apart timber by timber. They were at it again now, toiling away in the light of their lamps.</p>

<p>
With the waves thundering on the beach beside us, we rode far to the east, well beyond the place where I'd found the trail of Daft Willy. I looked toward the rolling dunes, all silver in the moonlight, and didn't see the sail out on Firth until Mr. Campbell pointed it out.</p>

<p>
''What do you make of that, Jim? You with your young eyes," he asked. ''Are my old ones playing tricks on me, or is there not a ship out there?"</p>

<p>
I stared into the wind, seeing nothing at first. Then I saw the sail of a lugger, perhaps a mile off, rocking in the swells.</p>

<p>
''Is it a free trader?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Well now, Jim," said Mr. Campbell. ''Safe to say, it's not a boatload of devil dodgers."</p>

<p>
I had to smile at his image of clergymen out on the dark sea. Then we got down from our horses, and Mr. Campbell took his lantern from its place behind his saddle.</p>

<p>
''Help me, Jim," he said. ''We'll pull the wool over the eyes of those black sheep."</p>

<p>
We lit the lantern through a little panel in its back. There was a cap on its top, so that when the panel was closed, the only light came out in a spot through the end of the spout. Mr. Campbell aimed it toward the lugger, and, tapping his hand on the opening, flashed a signal across the sea.</p>

<p>
In an instant, an answering light came back from the lugger, a series of blinks that seemed, somehow, like shouts in the darkness. Then Mr. Campbell flashed his lantern three times, his hand going slap-slap-slap on the spout, and he quickly extinguished the flame.</p>

<p>
At almost the same moment, the sail turned to catch the wind, and the lugger bore off to the west.</p>

<p>
''There," said Mr. Campbell. ''You see, Jim, that's the game. That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>
Well, I was quite dumbfounded to see all this. The lugger had been so indistinct that an owl might not have seen it. That Mr. Campbell could then chase it off with a few flashes of light was nearly beyond reasoning.</p>

<p>
''How did you know what signal to send?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Well, it didn't matter," he said, chuckling. ''I only confounded them, Jim. They were expecting one signal, but got another, so they cleared off."</p>

<p>
It was a very rummy trick, and we both laughed at his cleverness. Then, satisfied that we'd spared the coast from another run of contraband, we mounted our horses and returned to the inn.</p>

<p>
Once again, somehow, the sign of the Piper hung crookedly above the door. I was all for dragging out the tea chest to set it right again, but Mr. Campbell told me not to bother.</p>

<p>
''Leave it for the night," he said. ''I believe we've earned ourselves a dash of brandy."</p>

<p>
He gave me mine, mixed much with water. But we toasted my father's health and, though a little sickened by the brandy, I felt very grown up, and rather close to Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>
''You're a good lad, Jim," he said. ''Now off to bed, and no worries for what you might hear. A full moon like this, it often brings a soulless sailor."</p>

<p>
Well, a whole crew of them might have turned up, for all that I knew. The brandy put me straight to sleep, and I heard nothing all the night. Nor did my father in his new and quiet room, far removed from the inn's front door.</p>
