<p>
Over five months have passed since the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, and it is still impossible to get over the sheer perfection of the achievement. Even young people, for whom 1986 was only an expression, felt redemption, having been initiated into the fellowship of pain on Oct. 17, 2003. Had Grady Little taken the ball from Pedro Martinez on that terrible night, had the Red Sox gone on to win, or even to lose in a less macabre fashion, would the jubilation and sense of deliverance that swept the land last autumn have been as purifying and universally felt? No. Nor would the post-season have been the sublime passage it was had the Sox not come back against the evil Yankees after losing three, the last a hideous 19-8 bastinado session -- and come back, moreover, by hanging on through two grueling five-hour-plus games, and winning twice more, as no team had ever done before in the history of baseball.</p>

<p>
No sooner had the Red Sox begun to fix their hairdos to play host at Fenway to another old nemesis, the Cardinals, than the distant clatter of keyboards signaling books on the way became a thunderous pounding. If we do not count instant-book contributions, Stewart O'Nan and Stephen King's <strong>''Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season"</strong> (Scribner, $26) won the race. For those who have not read it, the book consists of eight months' worth of journals and exchanges between two companionable, Sox-crazy, middle-aged adolescents. After the Yankees are finally disposed of, O'Nan sums up the feat admirably: ''It's as if the Sox had walked through the Stadium driving stakes through every single ghost's, vampire's, and Yankee fan's rotten cobwebby heart."  And, later, as the Sox were nailing down the last outs of the World Series, King's 5-year-old grandson asks the question that sums it up for us all: ''Is this a dream or are we living real life?"</p>

<p>
Now, with the season underway, the real deluge of Red Sox books has begun, with those on the Boston-New York rivalry so numerous as to make up a genre of their own. The key work is Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy's <strong>''Reversing the Curse: Inside the 2004 Boston Red Sox"</strong> (Houghton Mifflin, $23). Though he did not (as he admits) originate the expression or even the notion, Shaughnessy is responsible for its development into an increasingly inane way of looking at the Red Sox. In the present book, athletic prowess and managerial cunning are of less moment than omens, hauntings, harbingers, convergences, celestial signs, and charmed numbers. One example will do, and that is Shaughnessy's wondering if the Sox's season-opening loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards was the consequence of that ballpark's having been built over the site of Babe Ruth's father's bar, so that ''for nine innings . . . Johnny Damon was standing where Ruth actually was a bambino." (It wasn't nine innings, by the way, as the Sox never made it to the field in the ninth.)</p>

<p>
If you can bear all this ''Seventh Seal" mumbo-jumbo, Shaughnessy's book does provide a tour through the season and treats us to a number of gratifyingly repulsive instances of Yankee behavior, among them, PR big bug Rick Cerrone reaming out a Sox parking attendant at Fort Myers: ''Don't you know who I am? I'm the public relations director of the American League Champion New York Yankees, and you know what? You are a typical Boston Red Sox employee."</p>

<p>
Of Yankee-Red Sox hostilities, Don Zimmer has said, ''It will never be the same as it was in the '70s. Back then it was real hatred. Fisk hated Munson. Munson hated Fisk. And everybody hated Bill Lee." Those edifying words introduce the very same Bill Lee's gleefully belligerent foreword to <strong>''Blood Feud: The Red Sox, the Yankees and the Struggle of Good Versus Evil,"</strong> by Bill Nowlin and Jim Prime (Rounder, paperback, $16.95). The book itself is a wide-ranging, many-pocketed history of the rivalry between the Sox and Yankees, as well as a chronicle of each team's successes and failures. For Red Sox fans, the postwar story of tragedies and pratfalls can almost be told in dates alone -- 1946, 1948, 1949, 1967, 1972, 1975, 1978, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2003 -- though the authors provide brisk narratives for each. Other aspects covered include the Stadium vs. Fenway, trades and sales between the two teams, the geographic boundary between Red Sox and Yankee fans, and synopses of Yankees-Red Sox series, including, naturally, a lengthy description of last year's final one. The book concludes with an afterword by Johnny Pesky, who, irenic guy that he is, rejects the notion of a blood feud, though he admits that you do ''get tired of coming in second."</p>

<p>
The Boston Herald's Tony Massarotti joins with the New York Daily News's John Harper to present an entertaining, two-sided account of last year's drama in <strong>''A Tale of Two Cities: The 2004 Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry and the War for the Pennant"</strong> (Lyons, paperback, $14.95). Massarotti takes the lifelong Sox fan's irreverent attitude toward the Red Sox organization, getting a good laugh out of John Henry's grousing after his foiled bid for Alex Rodriguez (a.k.a. A-Rod): ''It will suffice to say that we have a spending limit and the Yankees apparently don't."</p>

<p>
As book and season progress, Curt Schilling, with his inability to get enough of himself, and George ''Knute" Steinbrenner, who thinks baseball is football, are the two most amusing characters. Harper, who finds the Yankees more interesting when they lose, presents the Boss as somewhat mellowed but constantly irked by the Sox having lured the ''warrior" Schilling into their camp. Harper is especially penetrating in appraising the relationship between Steinbrenner and Joe Torre, and the psychological makeup of Derek Jeter, Gary Sheffield, and A-Rod. He also describes a Yankee clubhouse of self-sufficient millionaires lacking cohesion but confesses that he, like most other New Yorkers, thought the Red Sox' exuberant camaraderie was just the defensive pose of a vanquished team. For his part, Massarotti concludes with an exultant philippic, reminding New Yorkers that they must ''live with the reality that their Yankees, <em>their glorious Yankees,</em> are now the authors of the most monumental collapse in the history of team sports."</p>

<p>
<strong>''Emperors and Idiots: The Hundred-Year Rivalry Between the Yankees and Red Sox, From the Very Beginning to the End of the Curse"</strong> (Doubleday, $24.95), by The New York Post's Mike Vaccaro, pursues its mission in a slick feature-writing style. Woven with a distinct Yankee twist, the 2003 and 2004 Yankee-Red Sox playoffs are the woof of the narrative, while flashbacks to past contests and enmities, and snippets of fan and player reaction, are the warp.</p>

<p>
<strong>''The Yankees vs. Red Sox Reader,"</strong> edited by Mike Robbins (Carroll &amp; Graf, paperback, $15.95), is a collection of 39 pieces on the same subject with contributions from the likes of Red Smith, Roger Angell, Peter Gammons, and even a descendant of Harry Frazee.</p>

<p>
<strong>''Red Sox vs. Yankees: The Great Rivalry," </strong>by Harvey Frommer and Frederic J. Frommer (Sports Publishing LLC, paperback, $14.95), has been significantly revised from last year's hardcover version to take in the great events of last year. Filled with photos and chatty observation, it has lost some of its former distinctly pro-Yankee slant.</p>

<p>
Johnny Damon's <strong>''Idiot</strong><strong>: Beating 'The Curse' and Enjoying the Game of Life"</strong> (Crown, $24) is the book his worshipers have been waiting for -- though some will be surprised to learn that the deity's first thought on seeing  the Aaron Boone home run that eliminated the Sox in 2003 was <em>''What a great series!"</em>  Still, as this book shows, Damon is given to taking both sides on numerous issues, including steroids, the role of statistics, and various front-office decisions. When it comes to hair, however, he speaks with conviction: ''We don't judge by hair alone. We embrace whatever a guy wants to do even if it looks bad."</p>

<p>
The Red Sox' triumph last year allows us to read former Sox general manager Lou Gorman's <strong>''One Pitch From Glory: A Decade of Running the Red Sox"</strong> (Sports Publishing LLC, $24.95) without weeping. The pitch in question was the one that turned the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets into a nightmare, one that for Gorman had an added dimension of surreality in that he had helped to build the New York team. Written with exasperating circumspection and in a style that has all the brio of an annual report, the book does take us through Gorman's reasoning behind such trades as dealing Jeff Bagwell for Larry Andersen, and Curt Schilling and Brady Anderson for Mike Boddicker. He also reveals for the first time that, after the doleful 1993 season, he considered a ''desperate and excruciating" move: trading Roger Clemens. The Rocket was made part of a nine-player deal that would have sent him to Houston, home for him, but the whole thing fell through.</p>

<p>
Reflecting on his tenure as general manager from 1984 to 1993, Gorman tries to describe the vexed conditions under which he operated without being negative. With the exception, perhaps, of the Boston media and his ''friendly nemesis" Shaughnessy, Gorman's chief trial was the egregious interference of the owners:  Jean Yawkey -- or, rather, her ''alter-ego," John Harrington -- and Haywood Sullivan. Not that they represented a united front, either. ''The last three years of my reign," writes Gorman in his trademark style, ''were probably the most difficult and the most challenging because of the unfortunate disagreement between Mrs. Yawkey and Haywood, which became very unpleasant and greatly affected my opportunity to function without certain difficulties or constraints."</p>

<p>
Gorman does say that he was as shocked as Joe Morgan was by the popular manager's being given the hook, just as he was by pitching coach Rich Gale's surprise dismissal -- and by his own, for that matter. We learn that he wished that the Sox could have come up with the money Rich Gedman asked for after the 1986 season, but we would have appreciated a little more openness on the real reason the catcher was hung out to dry, namely the baseball club owners' collusion in holding down salaries. But this, like much else, Gorman has kept to his canny self.</p>

<p>
Bill Lee, portside twirler for the Red Sox from 1969 to 1978, eephus practitioner, and number-one Yankee hater, continues the saga of his life that he began in ''The Wrong Stuff" with <strong>''Have Glove Will Travel: Adventures of a Baseball Vagabond"</strong> (written with Richard Lally, Crown, $23). Blackballed, in the major leagues' time-honored tradition, he ends up as a mascot of a Canadian hockey team, demonstrating trick pitches between periods in ''an arena filled with ravening hockey carnivores who consider baseball to be as macho an athletic endeavor as knitting."  From there it is on to playing and managing baseball of one sort or another, here and in Canada, Venezuela, Russia, and Cuba. There are drugs aplenty, a run for the presidency as candidate of the American Rhinoceros Party in 1988, and other, less civic-minded escapades. This is Lee at his best, which means worst, which means funny.</p>

<p>
Both Steve Bailey's <strong>''</strong><strong>Red Sox: Where Have You Gone?"</strong> (Sports Publishing LLC, $19.95) and Herb Crehan's <strong>''Red Sox <org idsrc="OTCBB" value="HERS">Heroes</org> of Yesteryear"</strong> (Rounder, paperback, $17.95) follow Red Sox players into the world beyond Fenway. Providing interviews, career assessments, and post-baseball-playing occupations, Bailey covers 50 players, while Crehan takes on 39, plus manager Joe Morgan. Surprisingly, the books overlap on only 15 selections, one of them being echt reliever Dick Radatz, respectfully known as ''The Monster," who died only last month. Crehan, whose entries were first published in Red Sox magazine and later expanded, recounts a seminal moment in Radatz's career: Coming in against the Yankees in the ninth, bases loaded, no outs, Radatz says, ''I struck out Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, and Elston Howard on ten pitches. I was so excited, I threw my arms up over my head, and that became my trademark for the rest of my career."  We learn from Bailey's conversation with the giant fireballer that it was Mantle who dubbed him ''The Monster." ''But," says Radatz, ''he had an adjective before it."</p>

<p>
If ever we get a complete picture of Ted Williams, it may be thanks to the indefatigable labors of Bill Nowlin, whose latest contribution to the store of lore is <strong>''The Kid: Ted Williams in San Diego"</strong> (Rounder, $24.95). The book, rich with illustrations, is a collection of 23 pieces, edited by Nowlin (a third of which were written or compiled by him), following Williams from his childhood  through high school on to his minor league career for San Diego and Minneapolis. The book investigates, it really seems, every statistic that ever adhered to the young phenom at the time, as well as every family root and fork in the road of his life.</p>

<p>
In <strong>''Boston's Ballparks and Arenas"</strong> (University Press of New England, $24.95), Alan E. Foulds looks at the grounds and edifices, past and present, whose histories make up a crucial part of the stories of the Boston teams who tenanted them. Among the histories chronicled here are those of Fenway Park, naturally, now the oldest baseball stadium in the majors, and that of the Huntington Avenue Grounds, first home of the Red Sox. There are historical accounts, too, of the South End Grounds and Braves Field, both home to Boston's departed National League team, as well as of Lincoln Park, ''Boston's forgotten field," host to black baseball teams from 1930 to 1936, ''a nearly invisible part of the city's past." In addition to a wealth of local and sports history, the book is supplied with terrific photographs.</p>

<p>
Robert Sullivan, transplanted from New England to New York, is a member of the Benevolent Loyal Order of Honorable and Ancient Red Sox Diehard Sufferers (BLOHARDS). <strong>''Our Red Sox: A Story of Family, Friends, and Fenway"</strong> (Emmis, $18.95) is his garrulous account of the doings of that esteemed body and of his family's passionate attachment to the Sox. Sullivan's desire to instill a love of baseball in his young daughter led to her being knocked out by a foul ball at a Lowell Spinners game, a first taste of baseball calamity, from which she most fortunately recovered.</p>

<p>
The spring's oddest book could be Gerard Purciello's <strong>''The Year They Won: A Tale of the Boston Red Sox"</strong> (Brown Barn, paperback, $8.95), for in writing this little novel for readers 10 and up, the author assumed that the Sox would not win in 2004, though possibly in 2018. Now revised and set in 2024, the book tells the story of four 12-year-old buddies who live in a world where dishes, placed in the ''Cleanerama," are sterilized by ''a low-intensity nuclear blast." Nonetheless, they still refer to each other in ancient boys'-book argot as ''ya big ox" and ''ya big galoot" and set off on an adventure to bring the World Series Championship to the Sox.</p>

<p>
Even as you read these words, it is a certainty that more books on the Sox are making their way into the world. Red Sox devotion, born in the bone, cannot be driven from the blood -- or kept out of print.</p></div>
