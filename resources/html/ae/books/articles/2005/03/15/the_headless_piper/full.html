<p>
By IAIN LAWRENCE</p>

<p>
The Headless Piper was a sprawling old inn at the edge of the sea. From its roof sprouted four crooked chimneys, yet smoke rose only from one, though the day was bitterly cold.</p>

<p>
I led Ready Aye Ready to the door, where the inn's wooden sign hung askew in a pair of old chains. It showed a skeleton wrapped in tartan, clasping bagpipes in its bony arms. It was dancing a jig atop its own skull, which lay grinning on the ground.</p>

<p>
The picture unsettled my mother. She cried out from the cart, ''Look at that, Jim! Why we've come to death's door."</p>

<p>
''Mother, it's an <em>inn</em>," I said. ''Help me carry Father."</p>

<p>
We bore him into a parlor where a fire smoldered in the hearth. His hacking coughs brought the keeper from the upper floor, in a great clatter on the stairs. Tall and thin, red of skin and hair, he made me think of a giant carrot.</p>

<p>
''Mr. Campbell?" I asked, and he nodded.</p>

<p>
So this was the man we'd been sent to see. I had to shout at him again, for the Scots spoke a language more foreign to me than French. ''Will you help us? My father's dying, I think."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell made a sour face. ''Lad, there's no need to shout," he said. ''I'm not deaf, you know." Then he smiled broadly. ''Oh, crikey, you're English! Come in, come in."</p>

<p>
He took my mother's share of the burden and helped carry Father through the parlor, weaving past the tables and the chairs.</p>

<p>
''It's a world of heathens up here," he said. ''When I came from Portsmouth -- eight years ago now -- I thought I'd come to a village of idiots. Between their braes and burns and bairns, I couldn't make hide nor hair of it."</p>

<p>
We passed from the parlor to a room that must have been his own. There was a shelf of books, a rocking chair, and in the middle a big feather bed where we laid my father down.</p>

<p>
''Put bricks on the fire, woman," he said to my mother. ''Get the kettle boiling."</p>

<p>
She scurried from the room while Mr. Campbell started fussing with blankets. I tapped him on the shoulder, and when he looked up I whispered. ''I saw the fox."</p>

<p>
The message from the rider clearly made no sense to Mr. Campbell. ''You saw the <em>what</em>?" he asked, frowning.</p>

<p>
''The fox." I shaped my fingers into little pointed ears above my own. I tried to twitch my nose. ''I saw the fox," I whispered again.</p>

<p>
He looked at me as though I were one of his village idiots. ''Here, I've no time for nonsense," he said. ''Off you go and have a look round the village while I see to your father. Go wherever you please, but mind you stay out of the Culbin Sands."</p>

<p>
''I don't know what they are," I said.</p>

<p>
''Keep it that way," said Mr. Campbell. ''There's many a man gone into the Sands and never come out. When wind is blowing from the sea, you can hear them howling in their graves."</p>

<p>
I gave my promise to keep out of the Sands, but of course I now longed to see them. Then I kissed my father on the cheek -- it was hot as a smithy's forge -- and left the room.</p>

<p>
There was no saddle for Ready Aye Ready. I sat on his bristly back and rode to the east through the village, above a quiet harbor where the tide had run out. Small fishing boats sat askew in the mud, where flocks of gulls pecked for cockles and sea worms.</p>

<p>
I passed fewer than a dozen people, mostly shrunken old women in enormous boots. Then I came to a flat beach of hard sand strewn with pebbles, and kicked old Ready to make him run. With a wheeze and a cough he broke into a staggering gait.</p>

<p>
The broad Moray Firth was on my left. Gray seas folded over themselves and dashed against the sand. Ready splashed through foam and froth, and the little brown sandpipers went scurrying away, and the gulls wheeled in circles above us. It was a pity Ready was half blind, for he might have enjoyed it. But soon he tired, and I let him plod along instead, not really minding how slowly he went. I closed my jacket against the chill of the wind, and watched a cutter beating to weather out on the Firth. Then we rounded a headland, and I saw the Sands.</p>

<p>
White as snow, barren as a desert, they covered the Earth as far as I could see. It was as though the waves of the Firth, meeting the land, became solid and huge. One after the other they rolled inland, growing taller and taller, until they lapped at the snow-covered mountains. It seemed they <em>became</em> the mountains, the silver sand piling monstrously high, turning to shining, snow-covered rock.</p>

<p>
It was beautiful, but desolate as well. There was such a loneliness about the place that a shiver ran through me and not from the cold. I watched a scurry of sand blow over the beach and settle at the bottom of the dunes. From the top rose a white puff. It amazed me to think that this was how the great waves had been built by grains at a time and this was how they moved, in tiny breaths and puffs. Then I thought of the ages that had passed in the piling of the Sands, and the emptiness of that place left me feeling as lonely as the land itself.</p>

<p>
Another flurry of sand went by. Ready turned his head to keep it from his eyes, and when I looked down there was already the tiniest of little dunes forming against his hoof, as though the Sands were trying to bury us.</p>

<p>
<em>When the wind is from the sea</em>. Mr. Campbell's words came into my mind, and I wondered if I would hear those voices, the cries of people long lost in the Sands. Would they come from under the ground? Or did the people shuffle themselves to the surface? Were the voices those of people buried or un-buried?</p>

<p>
There couldn't be dead men walking in daytime, I told myself. Surely not now, with the sky so bright and the sand a'glitter. Then I looked out across the Firth and saw how low the sun had gotten, how near I was to night already. I turned the horse around.</p>

<p>
Poor Ready had never moved very fast. But now he seemed to plod his way across a beach of paste and glue. His ribs heaved; his breaths whistled. The waves were rumbling on the beach, and the seagulls were crying, and I heard the voices from the Sands.</p>

<p>
They came without words, as a wail and a moan, as of a thousand souls lamenting. I had never heard such a sound in my most terrible of nightmares.</p>

<p>
''Run!" I told Ready. I kicked his ribs. I thrashed the reins against his neck.</p>

<p>
Off he went, at the same plodding pace. A front hoof, a back hoof; he couldn't bother to lift any more than one at a time.</p>

<p>
There was another howl from the Sands. Longer and stranger than the first, it made my hair stand up, my heart beat quickly. I tightened my legs around Ready, took his mane in my hands, and looked back over my shoulder.</p>

<p>
A man was behind us. He carried a box with a strapped handle, and it swung near his knees as he came weaving along the beach in fits and starts. One moment he was down by the water, the next he was high up by the stranded weeds and kelp. He scuttled and dashed like the crabs and the sandpipers.</p>

<p>
He could only have come from the Sands, for the beach there was long and straight. He had wandered from the dunes where the voices were calling.</p>

<p>
I tried to outpace him, but he walked more quickly than Ready could run, gaining a few yards every minute. I soon heard the rapping of that box against his knee, and saw what a wild-looking figure he was. His black locks hung in long tangles, blown by the wind. His britches were torn, his sleeves in rags.</p>

<p>
''Come on, Ready," I said. I showed her my heels, but it did no good. Her head snaked round as she tried to take a nip from my leg.</p>

<p>
''Run!" I cried. The shambling man was closer. ''You old glue pot, you run!"</p>

<p>
I whipped old Ready with the reins. They cracked against his shoulders, and he looked back with a little cry, with such fright in his eyes that I was instantly sorry. ''Oh I know," I said. ''You <em>are</em> running."</p>

<p>
I jumped down to the beach. I staggered and fell, taking a mouthful of sand. Then I got up and passed the horse. That was how fast old Ready would move; in three or four steps I could pass him.</p>

<p>
I grabbed his bridle and held it high. His lips twisted round the bit, showing teeth like yellowed gravestones. But with his head pushed up, he began to prance. He stepped high and fast, flinging pebbles from his hooves, snorting like a bull. He kept pace with me as I jogged toward the village, and it was likely the fastest he had moved in years. The shambling man fell steadily behind us. When we came in among the buildings I could no longer see him.</p>

<p>
I soon found my mother seated in front of the inn, on an overturned box that had once held ribbons. Father's fine cloth was strewn on the road. So were his tapes and needles and thimbles. The whole cart had been emptied, our goods scattered, and now Mother sat red-eyed and crying. I feared it was the worst of news, and ran to hold her. But she was angry, not sad. She pushed me away.</p>

<p>
''That fool of a father of yours," she said. ''Do you know what he paid for that horse and that cart? Do you know how much he frittered away along the road?"</p>

<p>
I shook my head.</p>

<p>
''Every farthing, the fool! All of it, Jim, and we're penniless now." She sobbed. ''We can't even pay for our keep."</p>

<p>
''But what of our goods?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Worthless! Look at them, Jim." She kicked at a little pile of red ribbons. ''The cloth is spoiled; the pins are rusted. It's all rubbish now! Mr. Campbell will give us a guinea for the lot, and we're lucky to get it, I say. The cart is firewood. I won't get tuppence for that old nag."</p>

<p>
''You can't sell Ready!" I said. ''What would happen to us then?"</p>

<p>
''That's already decided." My mother looked up at me. ''You'll stay with your father, and I'll go home. Because your father's such an addled fool, you're to work for Mr. Campbell."</p>

<p>
''Here at the inn?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Of course at the inn. You stupid boy, what more would you do for an <em>innkeeper</em>?"</p>

<p>
I had no way of knowing then, but there was a lot more that I might do. My work would send me out in the moonlight, riding the lonely shore below the Culbin Sands. It would bring me face to face with the shambling man, and with others I couldn't have imagined.</p>
