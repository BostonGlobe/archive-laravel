<strong>THE STORY SO FAR: </strong><em>It is 1803, and the French </em><em>em</em><em>peror Napoleon has conquered much of Europe. In England, people fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father packs up his family and moves north to Scotland, where he thinks they will be safe. A strange man on horseback tells them to go to the Headless Piper inn and tell the innkeeper they have seen the fox. When they arrive, however, the innkeeper appears not to know what Jim is talking about. While he takes care of Jim's father, who has become very sick, the innkeeper sends Jim out to explore the village, telling him to stay away from the Culbin Sands. Of course, that is precisely where Jim goes. But those drifting sands by the ocean are so frightening, and another strange man coming toward them so odd, that he heads quickly back to the inn. There, his mother tells him she is going back to England, and Jim is to stay at the inn and work for Mr. Campbell, the innkeeper, as the family has no money.</em></p><table

<p>
Mr. Campbell went to Inverness within the week of our arrival. My mother went with him, but didn't return. She sold her wedding ring and sailed on from there to England.</p>

<p>
To reach Inverness was a day's travel by boat, or two by horse, and so Mr. Campbell was gone overnight. I had to tend by myself to the parlor, serving the fishermen who came in their woolen britches and tam-o'-shanters, bringing a smell of the sea.</p>

<p>
As my father lay coughing in his bed, I carried glasses of frothy ale as quickly as I could fill them from the beer engine at the bar. The fishermen sat rolling on their chairs, as though still seated in their open boats upon the heaving Moray Firth. There were perhaps a dozen altogether, but only three who came every night. One was Donald John McDonald, with a face like a fish's, and another John Donald McDonald, who was missing one eye. But the third I thought of only as Strawberry Nose, for that part of his face was so swollen and red that I feared it might burst.</p>

<p>
Amongst themselves, they spoke Gaelic. But for my benefit they sometimes talked in what they believed -- rather fancifully -- to be English. ''Och," they would say. ''Hoot, ye wee laddie, it's a bra nicht the nicht."</p>

<p>
On this night when I was alone, Donald John McDonald nudged a chair and told me to ''haul alongside."</p>

<p>
It was late then, and all but these three had left. So I sat at their table, and they filled my head with stories of hauntings and spirits. Theirs were the most curdling tales, and I knew that I would lose many nights of sleep thinking of the spectral lady who rapped at midnight on the windows of the inn, or of the black beast of the Sands, or the headless piper himself. But worst of all was the ghost ship.</p>

<p>
''Och, it sank wi'in sicht o' the inn," said Donald John McDonald. ''And it sinks again and again, wi' a' the men screamin' an' the wind a'shriekin' when the wind is calm."</p>

<p>
''Och, get awa'!" said Strawberry Nose. ''When the Firth is rough, that's when ye see the ghost ship."</p>

<p>
''Ye dinna ken whit ye're saying, ye old bodach," said one-eyed John Donald McDonald. ''I saw it myself on the clearest night. No' a breath o' wind, and no' a ripple on the sea, but I heard a gale a'blowin', and the surf a'poundin', and that very nicht the sailor came ashore."</p>

<p>
''Aye, Jim, that's true." Donald John McDonald nodded his fishy face. ''We a' saw him. Half drooned, shamblin' like an old bodach, he came oot frae the sea in his old sailor clothes. He knocked at the door o' the Headless Piper."</p>

<p>
''What happened?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Why, Campbell let him in," said Strawberry Nose. ''We watched the ghostie pass through the parlor and doon the stairs. And listen, Jim. He went doon, but he never came up."</p>

<p>
''Ye might hear him tapping tonight," added John Donald McDonald. Then he tapped his own pipe on the table. ''But dinna fear, laddie. It's only a drooned seaman."</p>

<p>
That night I went trembling to my bed, guarding my candle's flame most carefully. When Mr. Campbell returned I asked him straight out if the story were true.</p>

<p>
''It's only half of it, Jim," he told me.</p>

<p>
He said the ghost ship was a galleon from the Spanish Armada. It blundered into the Moray Firth in a stormy night and ran aground near the Sands. ''Six hundred men," he said. ''They fired the cannons, calling for help, but nobody came. The masts toppled, the ship broke up, and every man was drowned."</p>

<p>
We were cleaning the inn as he talked. I with a duster, he with a broom, we worked our way through the parlor and into his office. There was a roll-top desk with a quill and a candle.</p>

<p>
''Once in a while a person comes running to the inn," said he, ''all in a fit that a ship's in trouble out there. He's heard the cannons, or the screaming, or the waves and the ship breaking up. Maybe he's seen it, maybe not. But when he hauls you off to have a look, there's never anything there."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell reached into a cubby in the desk and brought out two coins that he placed in my palm. They glinted with gold, and when I looked closely I saw that they were Spanish. ''You can still find these on the beach," he said. ''After a storm, most likely."</p>

<p>
They gave truth to his whole story. I fancied that their cold touch carried a memory of the night of the wreck, for I could imagine the scene most clearly.</p>

<p>
''But is it true a sailor came ashore?" I asked. ''Did he knock at the inn?"</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell nodded. ''That's what gives <em>me</em> the shivers," he said. ''There's been more than one, I tell you. Few see them but me -- though you'll see them too, I'm sure. They always find their way to the inn."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell took the coins and placed them again in the desk. ''They come cold and scared, wandering from the dark like the lost souls that they are. It's the light in the windows that draws them, I think. On the night of their drowning they must have looked up at these very windows, for the Piper was here at the time. Or part of it was, at least."</p>

<p>
''How often do they come?" I asked.</p>

<p>
He didn't answer directly. ''Sometimes I can feel that one is on his way. I get the gooseflesh on my arms, and sure enough a sailor's soon to follow. Or someone sees the ghost ship, and I know one's bound to appear." His voice became soft. ''You hear their feet dragging on the road, then a pounding at the door. You look out and you'd swear it's flesh and blood standing there, as real as you or me. But their faces are pale, and when they talk it's in Spanish or French."</p>

<p>
''You really let them in?" said I.</p>

<p>
''Well, yes I do, Jim." He applied his broom to the floor, sweeping dust from a corner. ''You see, by my way of thinking they're harmless. Crikey, they suffered enough, wouldn't you say? So I show them into the old part of the Piper, where it's dark and the ceiling's low."</p>

<p>
He gathered a little pile of dust, and carefully swept it under the desk. ''Oh, it gives me the crawlies sometimes to think of them there. But it's true that they vanish. They never come up by the stairs. They only go down, as though it's into the earth they go."</p>

<p>
I was glad it was daylight, the sun shining bright in the window. I polished the sill and the panes, looking out at the long beach toward the Sands. I said, ''Mr. Campbell, I think I saw one of the sailors already."</p>

<p>
His broom clattered to the floor. ''Where? And when?" he asked. ''What did he look like, Jim?"</p>

<p>
''He was all in tatters. He was right over there." I pointed from the window and described the shambling man I'd seen while riding old Ready. ''He was carrying a box. Maybe it was a seachest."</p>

<p>
''I hardly think so." Mr. Campbell laughed as he picked up his broom. ''It sounds like you met Daft Willy."</p>

<p>
''Who's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Mrs. Fraser's boy. Poor lad was thrown from a horse one night. Or so I'm told, for it's before my coming. They don't talk much of Daft Willy, Jim. It upsets Mrs. Fraser. All I know is that Willy's forever rambling, putting little things into that box and taking them out again."</p>

<p>
I was embarrassed, and a bit disappointed, to learn that my imagined ghost was no more than a wandering idiot. Mr. Campbell must have seen this on my face, for he put his hand on my shoulder and told me, ''Don't go looking for ghosts, Jim. What's buried in the Sands is better left buried."</p>

<p>
''What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Well, that story will have to wait until your chores are done."</p>

<p>
I never worked so fast in my life. I flew from task to task, from room to room. But the sun had set when we seated ourselves in the parlor, close by the fire where the fishermen gathered. I could hear my father snoring. Mr. Campbell lit a pipe, crossed his legs, and began his story.</p>

<p>
There had been a time, he said, when the land to the east was covered with heather, not sand. In those days a baron had lived there, in a vast estate with croft houses and mills and stables. There were cattle in the pastures, ploughmen in the fields. There were vast orchards where the trees groaned with fruit. The baron himself lived in a huge mansion house made of stone.</p>

<p>
''Now, his father had lived there," said Mr. Campbell. ''His grandfather too, and the both of them had seen the sands moving inland from the sea. Slowly, mind you, Jim. Not a yard in a year. But that changed very suddenly."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell studied his pipe. ''Then the dunes advanced by leaps and bounds. Sand sifted over the pastures, over the fields and orchards. It blew in through the shutters and doors, and the housemaids were forever sweeping it from the mansion. And all the time the dunes kept rolling over top of each other, like the waves of a rising tide."</p>

<p>
''Why were they moving so quickly?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''That's the mystery," said he. ''The baron claimed his housemaids were witches. He said they'd put a spell on him, and -- Jim -- he had some of them burned at the stake. But some say it was the baron's doing, that he played cards with the devil and gambled away his estate and his soul. There's no doubt he was a smuggler, Jim, with a tunnel to the sea. But whoever was to blame, the end came quickly."</p>

<p>
I was sitting on the edge of my chair. But I had to wait for Mr. Campbell to refill his pipe.</p>

<p>
''There was a violent storm," he said. ''The winds whirled and the lightning flashed, and the dunes were flattened, Jim. It was as though the devil's hand was drawn across them, spreading them over the whole estate. The cattle were buried where they stood in the pastures. The orchards were covered, and then the houses, and last of all the mansion. When the storm eased, there was nothing to be seen but the chimneys of that great house, reaching from the sands like a dead man's fingers. And then those, too, were buried."</p>

<p>
''What of the baron?" I asked.</p>

''Well, now, Jim," said Mr. Campbell. ''I happen to know he was entombed inside, and there's many who say he's not the only one down there. They say the ploughmen are still in their fields, and the pickers in the orchards, and their wives and children as well. Think of it, Jim. Buried alive in the sand, a hundred feet down."</p>

<p>
He shook his head at the horror of it.</p>

<p>
''Now, Jim, the sands keep shifting, and things bubble to the surface," he said. ''Once it was a dead boy swam to the top. Mostly it's small things, like bottles and glasses and china. But . . ."</p>

<p>
Suddenly, from behind me, came a tapping, and I saw Mr. Campbell half jump in his chair.</p>

<p>
We had talked into the night. Only a dim glow from the fireplace lit the vast parlor, and Mr. Campbell stared over my shoulder, into the shadows.</p>
