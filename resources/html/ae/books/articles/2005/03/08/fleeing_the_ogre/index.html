<div id="page1"><p><em>Iain Lawrence's </em><em>''The Shifting Sands," a novel for young readers, is being published in The Boston Globe on eight consecutive Tuesdays beginning today. Teachers wishing to receive copies of the paper on those days, as well as curriculum materials developed for the story, should contact the Globe's Newspaper in Education office at 617-929-2639.</em></p><p>My father was always up and about before the sunrise. He liked to joke that he was the one who woke the rooster, and I was young enough to believe it was true.</p><p>In the darkness he slipped out with his spyglass under his arm and trekked down to the White Cliffs by the sea. Every dawn found him standing at the very edge of England, a black speck atop the miles of white chalk, like a lonely fly on a wall.</p><p>As the morning sun sparkled on his glass, he stared out at the Channel, out toward France. He stared down at the water and up at the sky, for Boney, he said, might come by balloon.</p><p>''That Corsican ogre!" he called him.</p><p>My father wasn't the only one who feared Napoleon. In that autumn of the year 1803, all of England waited for the emperor to come with his armies across the Channel.</p><p>He had conquered Europe, and now was choking the harbors of France with his barges and boats and ships. Where would he strike next but England?</p><p>It was an October morning when I went with my father down to the cliffs, down in the light of the moon. The ground had frosted, and the grass was hard and crunchy. Father breathed a mist from his mouth that froze on his beard. From the top of the cliff we could hear the surf rumbling on the beach, but the Channel was hidden by sea fog. As the sun rose, my father held up his spyglass.</p><p>''Boney's coming, Jim," he said.</p><p>I thought he was seeing things, for the Channel seemed empty to me. ''Where?" I asked, staring into the fog.</p><p>''Oh, not today." Father closed the spyglass. He swung it under his arm, then held his hands to his mouth and breathed smoky puffs on his fingers. ''But mark my words, he's coming, Jim. And I won't pass another winter like this, waiting in the cold."</p><p>Our lives changed that morning. Before the sun had set, my father had sold his shop and bought a horse and cart.</p><p>My mother was furious.</p><p>''What of poor Jim?" she said. ''He was to follow you into the business."</p><p>''I'll open another one," said Father. ''Somewhere far to the north. In the Highlands, I think. There's always a call for haberdashers, and particularly so in Scotland."</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>''Scotland!" she cried. ''Why, we'll catch our deaths on the road. Winter's coming, you fool!"</p><p>''So are the Frenchies," he said.</p><p>My mother was a hard lady, but my father was stubborn. He had made up his mind, and our die was cast. Anything he couldn't pile on the cart, he gave to charity, and we struck out to the north.</p><p>It seemed silly to be fleeing from the Corsican ogre through a country that was quiet and peaceful. In the orchards, sturdy women were picking the last bushels of red apples. In the fields, men and boys were plowing, and the villages bustled with their business. Every person we passed stared at our overfilled cart and our poor, wheezing horse. The boys laughed, and the men shook their heads.</p><p>It was no wonder. The tools of my father's trade were ribbons and threads and buttons. He knew nothing of horses and had chosen one that was half-blind and as stubborn as himself. Its name was Ready Aye Ready, but it had to be coaxed and pulled over every mile, and my father's wild hopes of making 20 miles a day were quickly dashed.</p><p>But he pushed on, and in his mind we kept only steps in front of Napoleon. Every moment, he expected the French cavalry to come charging up the road behind us, sabers drawn and pennants flying.</p><p>Mother begged him to stop in London, but he'd have none of that.</p><p>''London's finished," he said. ''Boney will sack it; he'll burn it."</p><p>So we passed right through the city and went trundling up the Great North Road. The days became weeks. Winter caught us up.</p><p>When we crossed the Scottish border, it was snowing, and Father was wheezing as heavily as the horse. Head down, bundled in layers of clothes, he waded through drifts as high as his knees, pulling at the bridles.</p><p>We struggled on, as day by day the weather worsened. We passed from forest to field, then into a desolate land of barren hills.</p><p>Then, one evening, we saw seabirds in the sky, and Father said we were near Inverness.</p><p>''The gates to the Highlands," he said. ''That will be far enough."</p><p>But the morning brought a blizzard to the high hills. Three times Father led old Ready Aye Ready into the snow-filled ditch. Three times we unloaded the cart, labored it out of the ditch, and filled it again.</p><p>Father cast away boxes of buttons and a chest full of thread, trying to lighten the load. But poor Ready still slithered in the snow. He stumbled in the harness, and again the wagon toppled into the ditch.</p><p>Father cursed. He coughed and groaned and cursed again. Then he struck the wretched horse with his fist.</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>''Father, don't," I said.</p><p>He kept bashing the horse, over and over, pounding at its shoulders and its head. Old Ready whinnied and wheezed, and at last Father collapsed on the road with his head in his hands. He wept like a child.</p><p>''Get up!" shouted Mother. Night was coming, and we had miles to travel before we'd find an inn.</p><p>But Father only huddled there as the snow piled up on his shoulders. He moaned and shivered. ''I don't feel well at all," he said.</p><p>''I told you so!" she shrieked at him. ''Didn't I say this would be the death of us?"</p><p>His teeth were chattering, his beard dripping icicles. ''It's over," he said. ''We tried, and we lost."</p><p>I took his place then. It was as though he were the child, and I the man. While he sat crying in the snow, I shifted our boxes from the cart to the road. The sun went down and the moon came up, and a silvery glow fell over the land.</p><p>Far away, a wolf howled. Another answered.</p><p>I was frozen to the marrow, but my feet seemed to be burning in my boots. My hands were wooden tongs that clamped on the boxes without feeling.</p><p>Mother pulled out bolts of cloth and wrapped my father in them. She held him close, so tightly that when he shivered, so did she.</p><p>''Hurry," she told me in a whisper. ''Jim, he's dying."</p><p>I could work no faster. I clawed at the snow that held the cart. Though I dug like a dog, I hadn't a hope of freeing it.</p><p>Then, over the moonlit hills, along the road behind us, came a horseman at a gallop.</p><p>He was like a phantom slipping along, a blue shadow in a whirl of snow. We heard the snorting of his great black horse, but no sound from the hooves.</p><p>We saw the rider clutching its back, his coat flapping behind him. The horse ran like the wind, and the wolves kept howling.</p><p>Old Ready Aye Ready shook his head and snorted. My father trembled all over.</p><p>''It's the devil himself," he said.</p><p>I stood up in the road, but the rider neither turned nor slowed the horse. He slapped its shoulder and kicked its flank.</p><p>I held up my hand. ''Stop!" I cried.</p><p>At the very last moment the rider reined in, and the huge horse reared up, snorting great clouds of fog. Its black mane thrashing, forefeet kicking, it spun once around as the rider stood in his stirrups. Then he calmed it with his hands, and the horse --  snorting furiously -- pranced back and forth in front of me.</p><p>''You might have been killed," he said. ''Why do you stand in my path?"</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>''Please help us," I said.</p><p>He wore high leather boots and a soldier's woolen greatcoat. But his head was bare, his hands without gloves, and from his eyes to his mouth a thin layer of ice covered his face like a shimmering mask. He looked down at our toppled cart and our piles of belongings, at Ready Aye Ready, at my father all swaddled in cloth. Then he shook his head. ''I can't stop. I'm sorry."</p><p>My mother shrieked at him. ''You're a sorry excuse, that's what you are! Get down from that beast, or you'll be damned if you don't."</p><p>A strange sound came out of the night, the eerie baying of hounds. It carried over the hills and through the starry sky. The rider looked back where he had ridden.</p><p>''You hear that?" she cried. ''You're hell-bent already, aren't you?"</p><p>''Be quiet, mother!" I snapped.</p><p>It was the first time I'd ever dared speak sharply to her, and it stunned her into silence.</p><p>''Sir, please," I begged the horseman. ''My father will die if he doesn't get to Inverness. Leave my mother and me if you like, but take him with you."</p><p>''He will never get to Inverness," said the rider. ''Not from here. You have taken the wrong turn."</p><p>It was too much for me, suddenly, to think that we were now lost, on top of all our problems. I very nearly burst into tears. But I blinked them back and stared as bravely as I could at the rider.</p><p>''Go on then," I said. ''I'm sorry I delayed you."</p><p>I turned my back on him. As I set to work, digging out the snow, I heard the leathery creak of his saddle and stirrups. I thought he was off on his journey. But much to my surprise, he appeared at my side, on foot, and began to help with the digging.</p><p>''I had a boy like you," he said. ''He, too, was afraid of nothing."</p><p>We cleared away the snow. We used the rider's horse to pull the cart free. As we loaded our boxes of tapes and thread, the baying of the dogs grew louder. The rider looked back, his face icy and pale, and I could see the truth in his eyes.</p><p>''They're hunting for <em>you</em>," I said.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>''Why?"</p><p>''To kill me," he said, his voice slurred by the cold. He took my sleeve in his frozen fist. ''Keep to the road, do you hear? Bear right when it forks. Bear right every time."</p><p>''Yes, sir," I said.</p><p>''You will come to the village of Glenard, by the Moray Firth, and an inn with the sign of the Headless Piper. Duncan Campbell is the keeper. Go and see him, boy."</p><p>Over the hill, as though stepping from the starry sky, came a line of men on foot and horseback. The hounds ran before them, darting left and right. The rider pulled me closer.</p><p>''Tell this to him, and to no one else," he said, his teeth chattering. ''Tell him you met the fox. Remember that. You met the fox."</p><p>Then he was gone. He leaped to the saddle and grabbed the reins. He didn't follow the road but went dashing over the hills, a shadow again, flitting through the night. The men and the hounds turned to follow him. They soon vanished over the hill, and that whole desolate land was ours.</p><p>I helped my father onto the cart. My mother sat holding him as I led Ready Aye Ready north toward Glenard, up the long hill that had beaten us.</p><p>The road forked. I went right. Then I heard, in the distance, the wild cries of the dogs rise to a frenzy. There was the faint popping from a volley of muskets, then all was silent. The fox, I thought, had been caught.</p><p>But it wasn't the last I would see of the man.<img
