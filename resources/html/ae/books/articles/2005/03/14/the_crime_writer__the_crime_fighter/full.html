<p>
A Metropolitan cop for 29 years, Joseph Elmer McCain was the bane of Boston's most notorious organized criminals, along with numerous lesser miscreants. Storied in local police history, he's unknown to the public. Now he's the subject of a new book: Jay Atkinson's ''Legends of Winter Hill: Cops, Con Men, and Joe McCain, the Last Real Detective," which arrives in stores tomorrow.</p>

<p>
Atkinson, 47, of Methuen is a freelance writer and college creative-writing teacher. In addition to short fiction and articles in magazines and newspapers, he has published two previous books: a novel, ''Caveman Politics," and a memoir, ''Ice Time: A Tale of Fathers, Sons and Hometown <org idsrc="OTCBB" value="HERS">Heroes</org>." A few years ago, a police officer friend told Atkinson, ''I have a story for you, about a cop named Joe McCain." Atkinson had never heard of him. They talked, and the policeman spun stories about the man. Atkinson says, ''I realized this was a hell of a story, a real yarn, a tale that needs to be told."</p>

<p>
Atkinson has a real-guy manner himself, with sharply chiseled features, spiky graying hair, and a measured way of talking. The Tir na nOg  Irish pub in Union Square seemed the right atmosphere to talk with him about a Somerville kid who had the life he wanted, full of adventures and derring-do, while never moving from his old neighborhood.</p>

<p>
Joe McCain, who died in 2001 at age 72, grew up on Marshall Street in the Winter Hill district, lied to get into the Navy at age 16, and never got a formal high school diploma. He came home, got married in 1959, and joined ''the Mets" -- the Metropolitan Police. He and his wife, Helen, bought a house on Ossipee Street, near Teele Square, where they lived their whole married lives.</p>

<p>
''The Mets" policed the Metropolitan District Commission parkways and facilities, until they were merged into the State Police in 1992. McCain started out as a uniformed patrolman on Revere Beach, where many of the worst thugs and wiseguys of the Boston underworld held court. He grew to know them well, and with his native intelligence, honesty, and toughness, he moved up from the street to the detective unit, and often worked with other law enforcement agencies on organized-crime fighting.</p>

<p>
The detective created a vast system of informants, and pursued many now-legendary killers and assorted other bad guys: Buddy McLean, Bernie McLaughlin, Richard ''The Pig" DeVincent, Joe ''The Animal" Barboza, James ''The Bear" Flemmi, John and James Martorano, and many others whose names are forgotten.</p>

<p>
In earlier days he was credited with several rescues: a man from a burning building, three boys from the ocean. There were awards and commendations, including the state's medal of honor for police officers. He also helped put away minor con men and fancier white-collar criminals, and in the late 1970s discovered and led the investigation of the notorious Revere child-sex ring, whose clients included a former chief resident in psychiatry at Children's Hospital and an assistant to the headmaster of the prestigious Fessenden School for Boys in Newton.</p>

<p>
Atkinson writes that McCain had a deep, gravelly voice and a warm touch with all kinds of people, including some of those he helped convict. ''He prided himself on helping more people than he put in jail," said his son, Joe McCain Jr., a Somerville police sergeant. ''If you were serious about trying to turn your life around, he was the guy to help you." He loathed ''dirty cops" and hated deals (such as that between the FBI and South Boston mobster James ''Whitey" Bulger) that would leave violent criminals unpunished.</p>

<p>
''I spent  2&#xBD; years reading files, old newspaper stories, interviewing people who knew him," Atkinson said. ''There were even bad guys who said to me, 'OK, for Joe McCain, I'll give you an hour. Here's my cellphone. Call me Saturday at the track.' "</p>

<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Public servant, private eye</span></span><br>After he was shot and gravely wounded in a Hyde Park drug sting in 1988 (McCain killed the shooter), ''Big Joe," as he was known, lay near death for days. During the family's bedside vigil, a nurse came in and told them that a young woman was in the lobby, insisting on seeing him. Joe Jr. went to see her. It turned out that years earlier she had been the victim of a vicious rape and beating, which the detective had investigated. She told McCain Jr., ''Were it not for your father, I would have killed myself."</p>

<p>
She explained, according to the son, that the elder McCain had ''told her that he would stand by her and that he would catch the man who attacked her." The rapist was caught and convicted, and the girl said she could never have testified without McCain's support. The family allowed her into the hospital room, and she put her arms around the unconscious man.</p>

<p>
Too tough to die, the cop recovered, though years later he died of complications of his wounds. But his police days were over. So he set up a private detective agency in the North End, McCain Investigations, and had a second career with almost as many adventures as the first. With all that he did, Joe McCain couldn't make a living on police work alone, and for most of his career had to moonlight as a roofer and a cement-truck driver for <org idsrc="other-OTC" value="BSND">Boston Sand and Gravel</org>.</p>

<p>
The book, which is largely a compendium of stories, also tells of Joe McCain Jr. and his struggles within the Somerville Police Department, and of Atkinson's own brief experience as a private eye, while researching the book, with the McCain agency (which is now closed). But the heart of the book is the old man's story.</p>

<p>
There's the time in 1965 when McCain arrested Joe Barboza, a vicious killer (himself the victim of a mob hit in 1976), for beating up a patron at a Revere Beach bar. In the jail, Barboza insulted McCain, saying he wasn't so tough without his gun. On the spot, the cop unbuckled his gun and nightstick, stepped in the cell, and invited Barboza to ''take a shot." He declined, and McCain said, ''I thought so."</p>

<p>
But it was the 1978 Revere child-sex ring, which McCain stumbled on through a tip, that disturbed him most.</p>

<p>
''Even with all the murderers and bad guys that he put away," Atkinson said, ''he would go home at night, kiss his wife, walk the dog, and sleep like a baby. But when it came to these well-heeled guys, with the imprimatur of upper-crust society, secretly molesting children, it sickened him so that he could not sleep. He was completely repulsed. He would rather spend time with some killer who had done 20 years in Walpole."</p>

<p>
<span class="crosshead"><span class="crosshead">Honoring old-school heroes</span></span><br>It isn't surprising that Joe McCain would appeal to Jay Atkinson, a sports lover who coaches youth hockey in Methuen. Atkinson says he has always been drawn to the interaction of the intellectual and the concrete lives of regular people, especially those without the airs and polish of elite education.</p>

<p>
''That has been a big part of my career," he said, ''balancing the solitary intellectual pursuit of the writer with the active life. At school I would be studying philosophy with kids who never went outside, and then I was hanging around with rugby players." He also wrestled and played soccer, and plays with the Boston Rugby Club.</p>

<p>
The oldest of five children, Atkinson was the first member of his extended family to go to college. He majored in philosophy and English literature at Acadia University in Nova Scotia and earned a master's degree in creative writing at the University of Florida. Besides writing and coaching, he teaches at Salem State College and Merrimack College in Andover. He is divorced and has a 10-year-old son.</p>

<p>
Atkinson says McCain, whom he never met (though he listened to many hours of tapes the detective made for a never-written autobiography), ''was a lot like my old man." James Atkinson, with little more education than McCain, ran a small insurance agency in Methuen. He died of a heart attack in middle age.</p>

<p>
McCain's moonlighting amazed Atkinson. ''That is so old-school, something my father would do," he said. ''He would have a second job when we were kids because he felt, coming out of the Depression, that you had to work all the time. Otherwise you weren't putting money away for your family, things could go bad, and you could end up with nothing."</p>

<p>
He sees his book, in part, as a meditation on ''what a hero has become in our society. If a kid runs in front of a car and someone pushes him out of the way, he'll be looking for a book deal or to be lionized. Joe McCain would do that on his way home from work, pull a kid out of the river, and never mention it to anybody."</p>

<p>

<p>
<h3>The real deal</h3></p>

<p>
This sort of dubious bargaining drove Joe McCain nuts. One of his favorite sayings was ''You can trust a thief once in a while, but never trust a liar." When he heard that [Joe] Barboza had negotiated a plea agreement and entered witness protection, McCain remarked, ''Would a murderer lie? Hell, you've got the big score already. You've got Mr. Shooter. Put him in the electric chair. Get rid of him. You're gonna make a deal with this guy? For what? There's no redeeming value to him."</p>

<p>
And he was right. Just a few years later, Joe Barboza, while still under witness protection, killed a man named Ricky Clay Wilson out West over $300,000 in stolen securities.</p>

<p>
But McCain was comforted by the fact that he and [Leo] Papile had taken Joe Barboza off the street twice, saving untold lives in the process.</p>
