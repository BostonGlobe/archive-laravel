<strong>THE STORY SO FAR:</strong> <em>It is 1803, and as the French Emperor Napoleon conquers much of Europe, people in England fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father packs up his family and moves north to Scotland, where he thinks they will be safe. A strange man on horseback, calling himself ''the fox," tells the family to go to the Headless Piper inn. There, the innkeeper, Mr. Campbell, tends to Jim's father, who has become quite ill. Jim goes out to explore the village but returns quickly, frightened by strange sounds coming from the dunes, called the Culbin Sands, and by the sight of a strange man walking toward him. The next day, Jim's mother goes back to England, and Jim stays at the inn to work for Mr. Campbell, as the family has no money. One night, Mr. Campbells tells Jim about a shipwreck years ago, and the ghosts of the drowned sailors who often come to the inn at night. He also says that years ago, the Culbin </em><em><em>Sands began growing and expanding and eventually filled and covered a huge mansion owned by a baron, who was thought to be a smuggler. The baron, his farm workers, their families, and his cattle were buried alive. </em></em></p><table

<p>
I heard again the sound that had startled us from stories of ghosts and buried mansions. It was a tap-tap-tap from the cold outside.</p>

<p>
The light from the fire cast a red glow on the massive beams above us. But it didn't reach the corners, and the room was black at its nether regions.</p>

<p>
''Who's there?" shouted Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>
There was no answer. Then a face appeared at the window, a face pressed close to the glass.</p>

<p>
It was an old hag of a woman, staring in at the two of us. She had unruly white hair, and more wrinkles than a month-old apple.</p>

<p>
''Oh, Mr. Campbell!" I said.</p>

<p>
''Steady, Jim," said he, rising from his chair. ''It's only Maggie Fraser, the old mother of poor Daft Willy. Wouldn't be caught dead coming into a beer parlor."</p>

<p>
He went out through the door. ''Here, Maggie, what's wrong?" he shouted.</p>

<p>
I heard her walk toward him. ''I havn'a seen my William today nor the last," she said in a creaking voice. '''Tain't like him to miss his tea, you know. William hasn'a missed his tea in all of two and twenty years."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell tried to tell her not to worry, but the old woman grew ever more distraught, until I could hear her weeping beyond the door. Then Mr. Campbell promised to go looking. ''This very minute," he said.</p>

<p>
We went together, he and I. But it was a curious way of searching. Had I been Mr. Campbell, I would have knocked at every door and raised an alarm through the village. Instead, he fetched a torch and we went alone through Glenard and down to the sea.</p>

<p>
''Willy!" I shouted. ''Willy!" I cried. ''Where are you?"</p>

<p>
''Oh, pipe down," said Mr. Campbell. ''You'll never see him if you're hollering like a banshee."</p>

<p>
Our talk of ghosts had made me nervous. In the flickering shadows from the torch, I saw drowned sailors and black beasts and headless pipers by the dozen. My heart leapt with every sight, but each of my phantoms soon dissolved into a heap of old kelp, or a stump, or a stone. My fears dissolved with them, so that I kept silent at first when I saw a ship on the Moray Firth.</p>

<p>
It showed no lights, but its mast and rigging were lined against the stars, its hull a blot on the moon-speckled water. When I was certain that it was really there, I said, ''Look, Mr. Campbell. There's a ship out there."</p>

<p>
''Impossible," said he. ''Believe me, Jim, there's not a chance."</p>

<p>
But I could see it very plainly. Waves were breaking on its hull, and a spark of moonlight twinkled, as though reflected from a metal fitting. ''There!" I said, and pointed.</p>

<p>
''No. I see nothing," he said. Then he held out the torch, as though hoping to cast its light across the sea. But all he did was blind me to the darkness, so that yellow spots floated in my eyes. He grunted. ''Come along, Jim. We've wasted enough time as it is."</p>

<p>
''Do you think it might be the ghost ship?" I asked. ''And that only I can see it?"</p>

<p>
He laughed most heartily, and clapped my shoulder.</p>

<p>
''Why, you're dead set on seeing ghosts, aren't you, Jim? Very well, then; if it pleases you, you've seen the ghost ship. Now can we head back?"</p>

<p>
''But what about Willy?" I asked.</p>

<p>
''Oh, don't worry, Jim," he told me. ''Mrs. Campbell will be in her bed by now. She'll be seeing the boy tomorrow, I'm sure."</p>

<p>
I slept like a log that night, to be woken just after dawn by a great clamor of excitement in the village. Below my room, men were shouting. ''There's a ship on the beach! There's a ship gone aground in the night."</p>

<p>
I saw it as soon as I looked from my window. A stout two-master lay heavily on its side, grounded by the falling tide.</p>

<p>
It was all I could do to keep from telling Mr. Campbell, ''I told you so." But he made no bones about it, and let everyone know that I'd been the first to see the ship.</p>

<p>
''The boy's got the eyes of a cat," he said proudly.</p>

<p>
The whole village turned out to see it. Even Maggie Fraser was there, gawking at the ship on its side. Men and boys swarmed around it, and I didn't miss my chance. I climbed to the slanted deck. I crawled through the hold and the cabins.</p>

<p>
It was a very disappointing sort of wreck. The ship had been carrying nothing but coal, and precious little of it at that. The sails were furled, and from the stern trailed a thick cable with a tattered end. But there was not a soul aboard, and not a man had come ashore. It was as though an empty ship had sailed into the Firth, squared herself away, then drifted ashore.</p>

<p>
''She's a Frenchie," said someone. ''Och, a blind man could see that," said another.</p>

<p>
The villagers slowly retreated from the ship as the tide came in. But it seemed they would never tire of gawking. So I wandered away, looking for coins in the sand and the kelp, and just around the next headland I came upon a line of footprints. They led up the beach and into the dunes of the Culbin Sands.</p>

<p>
Now it didn't even occur to me that these might have been the marks of one of Mr. Campbell's sailor ghosts. I did fancy for a while that I had stumbled onto the trail of a Frenchman who had somehow come ashore from the wreck. But at the very top of the beach, I found another strange mark: a tidy square pressed into the sand.</p>

<p>
So it was Daft Willy I was following. He paused here to set down his box, perhaps to shift it from one hand to another.</p>

<p>
I turned to shout along the beach, to alert others. But I never so much as opened my mouth. What a hero I would be, I thought, to lead Daft Willy home. Surely, every boy would like me then, and every girl clamor to be with me. Without a moment's hesitation, I set off into the Culbin Sands.</p>

<p>
It was like climbing a pile of grain or oats. My feet sank in to the ankles, and I had to lean forward to keep my balance. I reached the top of the first dune almost out of breath, but kept going, though I knew I shouldn't. The footprints were already fading.</p>

<p>
It was a sunlit day, with a pleasant crispness in the air, but the thought of all that was buried in the Sands gave me chills that were not from the cold. I went down the slope and up the next, down and up again, trudging along where Daft Willy had gone.</p>

<p>
Not half a mile from the sea, the footprints, already faint, suddenly ended. They came nearly to the top of a dune, but didn't cross its crest. It was as though Daft Willy had vanished in mid-stride, or that his next step had carried him down into the dunes. Just beyond the last mark, there was a cone hollowed out in the sand, as though a great hole was just now filling in. I could see its edges collapsing, the grains of sand tumbling down to the center. I felt that if I were to stand in the middle I would sink into the Sands as though into a whirlpool of water.</p>

<p>
I stepped back, afraid the hole would suddenly widen and swallow me. It seemed that was what had happened to Daft Willy, and I pictured him now buried upright in the sand, his reaching fingers frozen into claws. I turned and ran.</p>

<p>
It was truly alarming to see how quickly the Culbin Sands could hide all trace of its visitors. A wind was rising, and it swept dunes of all traces. It swept away Daft Willy's prints, and swept away my own, and I was soon walking where it seemed no man had ever walked before. If it had not been for the low winter sun, and for my shadow stretching like an arrow before me, I would have become hopelessly lost. As it was, I left the Sands more than a mile from where I'd entered, drawn off course by the passage of the sun.</p>

<p>
I reached the wreck on my homeward way, and passed the villagers in silence. I was afraid that no one would believe what I had seen, or that Mr. Campbell would be absolutely livid to hear that I'd nearly gotten lost on the Culbin Sands.</p>

<p>
So I sought out the home of Maggie Fraser, and she came to the door with great wads of bread dough stuck to her fingers. ''I'm kneading," she cried, and wouldn't touch the door.</p>

<p>
''I think I know what happened to Willy," I said. ''I think he went out on the Sands and . . ."</p>

<p>
''Och, ye wee loonie!" she shouted. ''Do ye think I dinna ken that myself? Awa' wi' ye now!"</p>

<p>
I decided to waste no more breath upon her, and turned to leave. She cried after me, ''Whit were ye daing oot on the Sands yerself? Ye wee rascal, I'll tell Campbell, I will!"</p>

<p>
I left with my ears burning, and ran all the way to the inn. It surprised me to find the sign of the piper -- which Mr. Campbell had carefully straightened only the day before -- now hanging crookedly again. I thought it might please him, and forestall his anger, if I saw to it myself. So I hurried through the parlor toward the cellar stairs, thinking I might find a ladder down there.</p>

<p>
But my father called out from his bed: ''Jim, is that you?"</p>

<p>
''Yes!" I shouted back. Then I heaved a sigh and went into his room.</p>

<p>
More pale than ever, he peered out at me from under his blankets. ''He's coming, isn't he, Jim? That Corsican ogre!"</p>

<p>
So news of the strange ship had found its way even to my father in his sick bed. I shook my head. ''No, Father. The ship was abandoned."</p>

<p>
All I could see were his eyes blinking at me. ''Jim," he said, ''I have no idea what you're talking about."</p>

<p>
''Why, the wreck!" I said, rather rudely. ''The French ship on the beach, of course."</p>

<p>
I thought his heart might fail him that very minute. He gasped as though he'd been doused with icy water. ''I knew it," he said. ''I knew it, Jim. A Frenchman came in the dead of the night, and Mr. Campbell let him in."</p>

<p>
