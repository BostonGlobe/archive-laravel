<div id="articleGraphs">
<div id="page1"><p><em>Deborah Wiles's ''Moves the Symphony True," a novel for young readers, is being published in The Boston Globe over eight consecutive Tuesdays. Teachers wishing to receive copies of the paper on those days, as well as curriculum materials developed for the story, should contact the Globe's Newspaper in Education Office at 617-929-2639.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>The story so far: On a June morning in Mabel, Miss., the elderly Mr. Norwood Boyd has died, leaving a note for House Jackson, a boy in town. Most kids in town think Mr. Boyd was crazy, and House doesn't want them to know that he liked Mr. Boyd and used to read to him every day. House sneaks back to Mr. Boyd's house to follow the directions in the note and is startled to find Mr. Pip, an old friend of Mr. Boyd. Then           <em> he sees someone else on the couch.</em>           </em></p><p>House thought his heart would pound right out of his chest. All thought stopped. In the morning's first light, the body was no more than a soft shadow. And its voice was a whisper. ''House?"</p><p>Cleebo! The blood rushed back to House's head along with his breath. In a second he was on top of Cleebo, throttling him, like he was wrestling a chicken to the ground to cut off its head. ''You moron!"</p><p>Cleebo's body went soft, as if Cleebo were relieved that he was being pummeled by House. House recognized the lack of resistance and stopped strangling Cleebo. Then he heard a sob. Cleebo began to cry. ''I thought you was a ghost!" Cleebo sobbed into his cupped hands until he shuddered.</p><p>House shook his friend. ''What are you doing here?"</p><p>Cleebo mopped at his face. ''I told my mama I was spendin' the night with you," he said. He hiccuped and snorted. ''I snuck in here hours ago, got scared, climbed up in this old couch. Next thing I know, I heard something in this room. I knew it was a ghost, I just knew it. I thought I was a goner, for sure!"</p><p>''You sleep like the dead, Cleebo," said House. ''I've been here for ages!"</p><p>Cleebo wiped at his eyes and shuddered one last time. ''All I wanted was to find the treasure -- just like you!"</p><p>''There ain't no treasure, Cleebo."</p><p>''You already looked?" asked Cleebo. His face wore the look of a little boy who'd just been told there were no more Popsicles in the freezer.</p><p>House didn't hesitate. ''Yes."</p><p>Cleebo sniffed through his tears. ''You ain't gonna tell nobody I cried, are you?"</p><p>House shook his head.</p><p>''Swear," said Cleebo. There was desperation in his voice.</p><p>House felt desperate, too. Desperate to tell somebody about this momentous thing that was happening to him. He couldn't keep it to himself.</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>''I'll tell you somethin' I won't tell nobody else," he said, ''and if you don't tell nobody about it, I won't tell nobody about you crying."</p><p>Cleebo swung his legs off the couch and sat up. ''Done."</p><p>House told him everything, the whole story. Almost.</p><p>''Are you sure?" asked Cleebo. ''He don't eat people?" He sounded disappointed.</p><p>House showed Cleebo the photograph of Pip.</p><p>''They had uniforms!" said Cleebo, a jealous glint in his eye.</p><p>House showed him ''Leaves of Grass." ''A gift," he said. He did not show him the note. He did not speak of his mother. He kept those things to himself.</p><p>When House was all told out, he and Cleebo and Eudora Welty walked to House's house. House tucked his note from Mr. Norwood Boyd inside ''Leaves of Grass" -- his treasure -- and put it under his pillow.</p><p>Cleebo slept on the other side of the same big bed on the sleeping porch. He snored louder than Eudora Welty. Together they made a snoring symphony. A symphony true. As House fell asleep, it came to him like a dream thought that maybe things happened, that people came into your life and went out again in their own way, on their own time, but in concert with everything else.</p><p>He fell asleep, and in his dream he somehow understood that there was life in death because something and someone was always left behind. He sensed a fairness to be found in all that was unfair, a gentleness to be found in all that was mean. There was even a sanity to be found in everything that seemed insane. Was that the symphony true? He couldn't have put these thoughts into words; they were just feelings floating in his mind, as he slept. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon. It would be another hot Mississippi day. It would be hotter than House could have ever imagined.</p><p>Ten o'clock in the morning came too early for House and Cleebo, but they showed up at Halleluia School with a happy Honey, who had Eudora Welty on a rope leash that she had threaded through a white tutu around the dog's neck. The baseball team and the pageant players gathered under the chinaberry tree.</p><p>''We're on death row," complained Cleebo.</p><p>''The show must go on, mes amis!" said Finesse. She dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. The handkerchief was white. Everything else about Finesse was black. All black. She spoke through the mesh of a black veil. She wore no jewelry -- she was in mourning, after all -- but three enormous black feathers protruded from her hat.</p><p>''She looks like a black widow spider!" said Ruby.</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>''. . . who caught a vulture!" said Dove, notebook in hand.</p><p>Melba stood next to Finesse, clutching her clipboard and acting like the death-row warden. ''Shhhh!" she hissed.</p><p>Finesse held up her hand as if she were signaling leniency for the doomed. ''As you all know," she said, ''I was forced to leave you abruptly yesterday. One of our eldest citizens, Mr. Norwood Boyd, has . . ." Finesse put her handkerchief to her mouth for a long moment and then sputtered melodramatically: ''died! He's dead, mes amis, dead as a doornail, I saw it with my own two eyes, my great-granddaddy's greatest boyhood friend, laying out at Snowberger's, still as death!" She sobbed one great sob into her handkerchief.</p><p>House and Cleebo exchanged a look.</p><p>''Mr. Norwood Boyd asked for no funeral, no memorial service," said Finesse, dabbing at her eyes. ''But we have been asked to somehow honor him with our pageant."</p><p>''Mean Man Boyd?" said one. ''What are we supposed to do -- kidnap kids around the county?"</p><p>''Cook 'em?" asked another. Laughter rolled around the group. Finesse looked stricken.</p><p>''None of these exaggerations is true, mes amis," she said, fresh tears in her eyes. ''These are rumors, legends, lies! Mr. Norwood Boyd was a great man! My great-granddaddy can tell you the truth. Doesn't anyone here know the truth about Mr. Norwood Boyd?"</p><p>''I know somethin' about him!" shouted Cleebo, but he caught himself as all eyes turned to him and House sucked in his breath.</p><p>''What do you know?" Finesse was suddenly delighted. ''Do tell!"</p><p>Cleebo scowled and thought fast. ''I know you ain't even related to the man, that's what I know!"</p><p>Finesse straightened her shoulders. ''I know something, too, Cleebo Wilson," She pulled a piece of paper from her straw tote bag and opened it carefully. ''My great-granddaddy was left a note by Mr. Norwood Boyd."</p><p>House's heart began to bang in his chest. Finesse said, ''I wanted to keep it private, but Poppy implored me to share it with you all because he says it has meaning for our pageant, and so I will." Finesse and House took a deep breath at the same time.</p><p>''It is shrouded in mystery, mes amis," said Finesse. Finesse looked pointedly at House. ''One must not read too much into such mystery."</p><p>''Read the dang note!" said Cleebo. Finesse cleared her throat, held the note in front of her flamboyantly, and read:</p><p>''I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game. It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with oxygen, give them a larger physical stoicism, tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic set, repair these losses, and be a blessing to us. Walt Whitman (1819-1892)"</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>House rocketed upright. Walt Whitman! Baseball!</p><p>Cleebo scrambled to his feet, too.</p><p>''That's what I say! Dispepper and all! A blessing! Baseball!" He sliced his glove back and forth at Finesse as if he might decapitate her with it. ''Me and some of the team made a vote this morning, and we decided we ain't gonna participate in no pageant. We need to practice for the big game!"</p><p>''I'm helping!" shouted Ruby, getting to her feet.</p><p>Everyone had a noisy opinion but House. Certain words from his note began to take shape in his mind and connect with Finesse's note. Clangor. Organ majestic. Perfect band. That could mean all this noise, all this noise right here. And baseball. What about baseball?</p><p>Melba Jane stomped a sandaled foot and shouted, ''Come to order! Hush right this minute!"</p><p>Finesse put her hands in front of her in a praying pose, bent her head, and stood silently until the group calmed. She looked up when all was quiet and said, ''It seems we have a revolt."</p><p>Before anyone could agree with her, House said in a clear voice, ''No, we don't." He gestured to the ball team. ''We'll be in the pageant."</p><p>''You will?" said Finesse</p><p>''We will?" said the ball players.</p><p>''No we won't!" said Cleebo.</p><p>But House had figured out something. Moves the symphony true. He knew what it meant. ''We can do what we want, right?" he asked Finesse. ''You said it's <em>our </em>pageant."</p><p>''Yes, " said Finesse in an uncertain voice.</p><p>''Then, we'll play baseball," said House. ''And we'll have a pageant."</p><p>''How do we do that?" Finesse had her handkerchief at her throat.</p><p>''I don't know," said House. ''You're the artistic genius, you figure it out." And then another idea came to House. It spoke itself before he could think it through. ''I got a book that'll tell us how. I'll bring it with me tomorrow."</p><p>His face was hot with embarrassment, but there was a rightness to the words, so he kept on going in spite of himself. ''We gotta go," he said. His mind was racing. He tried to keep up with the ideas as they tumbled around in his mind and out of his mouth. He tried not to think about the fact that he was talking more than he'd ever talked in front of people in his entire life, and that he was actually suggesting cooperating with Frances Schotz, making a spectacle out of himself and everyone else. He let his very soul speak. Or maybe it was Mr. Norwood Boyd's ghostly spirit, or his mother's sweet song, or Pip's sad story. Suddenly it was all connected. And suddenly it made sense.</p><p>''<em>Anybody</em> who wants to play ball can play," he said.</p><p>Kids were on their feet, excited.</p><p>Ruby hugged herself. ''Yes!"</p><p>''No!" shouted Finesse and Melba and Cleebo all at the same time.</p><p>''Yes!" said House and Ruby together.</p><p>House entreated his ball players. ''Your mothers want you in this pageant," he said, ''and you want to play ball. We can do both! Everybody wins. We'll beat them Redbugs, you'll see."</p><p>''I don't want to play ball!" shouted Honey. ''I want to tap dance!"</p><p>House laughed -- laughed! He was carried on the breeze of a new understanding. He scooped his sister up into his arms. ''You can be a dancer, Honey," he said. And, without his sunglasses this time, he mimicked himself from the day before and looked Frances Schotz full in the face. He even smiled at her. ''Right?"</p><p>Finesse blinked and swallowed. All around her there was excitement and confusion and a strange energy. She raised her eyebrows at House but she didn't fight him. Finally she had a pageant to direct. ''Mais oui," she replied softly.</p><p>It was coming together, the mystery, the symphony, and House knew what he had to do. It involved dazzle and clangor, chorus majestic and perfect band. It included Frances Schotz and Ruby and Melba and Cleebo and Honey and Miss Mattie, and his father, the ball players, all of Aurora County, Mississippi, even Eudora Welty. It involved baseball. A pageant. Several tutus, most likely. And one beautiful treasure.<img
