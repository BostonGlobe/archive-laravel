<div class="overline">MOVES THE SYMPHONY TRUE | CHAPTER EIGHT</div>
<h1>Finally, the symphony</h1>





<p class="byline"><span></span> <span class="date">November 15, 2005</span></p>
</div>

<div id="articleGraphs">
<div id="page1"><p><i>Deborah Wiles&#146;s "Moves the Symphony True," a novel for young readers, has been published in The Boston Globe on eight consecutive Tuesdays. This is the final chapter.</p><p>The story so far: In the small town of Mabel, Miss., Finesse Schotz is trying to organize a school pageant with all the children in town. Many of the boys have an important baseball game the same day, though, and don't want to be in the pageant. Inspired by a book he found at the home of an elderly man who died recently, House Jackson suggests the group stage the pageant and play baseball at the same time. When Finesse rejects the plan and stomps off in a huff, House runs after her to explain his plan. At that moment, Finesse's Uncle Jim-Bob, a rich actor who plays Dr. Dan Deavers on TV and who was going to finance the pageant, shows up.</i></p><p>Oh my golly, Uncle Jim-Bob, what are you doing here so soon?" Finesse fell into Dr. Dan Deavers's enormous embrace.</p><p>''Your stage doesn't fit the schoolhouse!" said Dr. Dan. ''I've come to supervise and to partake of a much-needed vacation." He took Finesse by the shoulders and said, ''I see your pageant is morphing into a very interesting amalgamation!"</p><p>Finesse began a real boo-hoo that could be heard all up and down Main Street. Dr. Dan ushered her inside the barber shop.</p><p>''I'd better get everybody!" said Melba, running back to the empty lot with her clipboard in her hands. ''Don't say anything important until I get back!"</p><p>House followed Finesse and Dr. Dan inside the barber shop. Pip was not there, but his second-in-command, Mr. Lamar Lackey, stopped his scissors in mid-clip so he could figure out the commotion.</p><p>To the smells of shaving lotion and the sounds of Finesse's sobs, the whole story was related from both Finesse's and House's point of view -- not to mention the rest of the town's, including Miss Mattie. Word had gotten around that Dr. Dan Deavers had been spotted at Schotz's Barber Shop, so a crowd began gathering from as far away as Raleigh -- even some Redbugs were there with their mamas -- all sardined into the barber shop and spilling onto the sidewalk.</p><p>''It's the best combination of artistic vision and athletics I ever heard!" said Dr. Dan/Jim-Bob, casting an admiring look in House's direction. ''But it will never work unless we go all-out! I have learned that when one is presented with an opportunity to become more than oneself, one always takes that opportunity gratefully. One acknowledges all offers of assistance and embraces the larger field, so to speak, of possibility! Let's do it! Let's plan and practice the pageant and the ballgame together. We can move part of the stage to the empty lot temporarily as well. It won't fit in the schoolhouse right now, so we'll make good use of it on the field. Voila! A problem turned into a possibility!</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>''Voila!" said Finesse. She beamed.</p><p>Dr. Dan had more offers for help than he could accommodate. ''Everyone gets a part!" he said.</p><p>Chores were assigned. Finesse would remain the artistic director. House would be the athletic director. Dr. Dan would indeed be their benefactor. Uniforms could not be delivered within two weeks' time, but makeshift T-shirts were ordered; bases, bats, balls, and more could be purchased, and a cooler full of good water would be provided. ''Bring your picnics to the empty lot and we'll all share!" said Dr. Dan. He had no idea that this statement meant he would be sampling 27 different kinds of pie and a hundred deviled eggs on the day of the pageant.</p><p>Along with the baseball gear came pageant paraphernalia: dresses made of crepe paper, wands made from rolls of wrapping paper, set pieces constructed, and furniture donated by all. Tutus and leotards abounded, even for the boys, who groaned but put them on and laughed themselves silly during rehearsals.</p><p>House went home each evening after practice, exhausted, lay across the big bed on the sleeping porch, and read ''Leaves of Grass." ''I know that book," said his father one night.</p><p>House's face colored up. He had never told his father the story.</p><p>''It was Mama's," he said. ''Mr. Norwood Boyd gave it to me."</p><p>His father nodded. ''Let me show you my favorite." House carefully handed him the book and his father took it with great tenderness. ''It reminds me of what a symphony people make together."</p><p>House blinked. ''What did you say?"</p><p>''Your mother used to say it all the time," said his father. ''No matter what happens," she'd say, ''it's part of the symphony true." She even said her death would be part of the symphony."</p><p>House swallowed. ''Do you believe that?"</p><p>His father turned the pages of the book and nodded. ''I guess I do. We take the bad with the good, we take the night with the day. Somehow it all works out." He smiled at House and gave him the book back. ''Look, here's the one I like."</p><p>''I Hear America Singing"</p><p>''I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,</p><p>Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it would be blithe and strong,</p><p>The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,</p><p>The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,</p><p>The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on</p><p>the steamboat deck,</p><p>The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,</p><p>The woodcutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morning, or at noon</p><p>intermission or at sundown,</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the</p><p>girl sewing or washing,</p><p>Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,</p><p>The day what belongs to the day -- at night the party of young fellows,</p><p>robust, friendly,</p><p>Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs."</p><p>It <em>was</em> a symphony true. That's what his mother and Mr. Norwood Boyd had known. They were all part of the same song. House imagined the life that had been Mr. Norwood Boyd's, the boy. He imagined the life that had been Walt Whitman's, the poet. He imagined the life that belonged to Finesse, the artist; Pip, the barber; Ruby, the catcher; Melba, the assistant; Dove, the reporter; Cleebo, the angry first-baseman; Bunch Snowberger, the undertaker; and himself, House, the what? What was he? He was many things, just as everyone <em>-- </em>tout le monde -- was many things. He was his mother's son, for one thing. And he was glad.</p><p>Two weeks later, the day came. Picnics were spread all around and glorious things happened in Aurora County, Miss., on the empty lot in back of Main Street and not too far from Halleluia School.</p><p>''Mes amis!" said Finesse. She stood on the pitcher's mound dressed entirely in sequined red as she addressed all of Aurora County, and much of Smith County as well, which was the home of the Raleigh Redbugs. ''I hope -- j'espere! -- you will love our performance as much as we have loved preparing it for you!"</p><p>And with that, they began. The Redbugs were up first. Dr. Dan was the umpire. House pitched a mean lowball. Ruby caught every ball thrown her way. Cleebo growled at first base. Melba Jane was the first-base foul judge. She held an open parasol with both hands, using it as a shield whenever the ball was hit. Wilkie Collins kept score on an enormous chalkboard, his nose pressed almost to the board. Dove wrote about all of it in her notebook from her seat on the home-team bench. Finesse reported the play-by-play, speaking into a real, working microphone.</p><p>The game emanated from within. It was organic, a renaissance of the ball-playing tradition. Between innings, the play flourished. House's father, along with so many hometown friends, shouted encouragement from the sidelines. A gaggle of girls wearing crepe-paper dresses danced the glories of Aurora County, from her pine forests to her white clapboard churches, sandy dirt roads, and old, kaput sawmill. The Mabel Middle School band -- all 12 members -- marched across the outfield and played ''Waltzing Matilda." Old Johnny Mercer jumped up in a moment of fervor to play the spoons, which led several couples to spontaneously square dance.</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>During the seventh inning stretch, Miss Mattie read a tribute to Mr. Norwood Rhinehart Beauregard Boyd and to all Dearly Departed Friends, which led folks on picnic blankets to tell their stories about Mr. Norwood Boyd. He had had friends.</p><p>''We are his family," said Miss Mattie in an uncharacteristic tender moment. ''We are each other's family." Snowberger's handkerchiefs were produced from picnic baskets all around. Eyes were dabbed. The show went on.</p><p>Finesse sang ''Beautiful Dreamer" after the eighth inning. All the boys but Cleebo danced -- in their tutus. They received a standing ovation and did several encores. And Honey? Honey started them off. She was front and center, a tapping star. She danced her heart out to ''The Star-Spangled Banner" with her partner, You-doggie, who wore a matching red, white, and blue tutu and who sat at perfect attention throughout the entire dance.</p><p>In the bottom of the 10th inning, with the score tied 24-24, a new player appeared on the Aurora County roster. He was old, short, with a stubbly spray of gray hair and black shiny eyes, his skin the color of the pine cones that dotted the forest floor. He was the only player wearing a uniform. It fit perfectly. As he came to bat, there was a hush in the crowd. The past and the present were connected. The batter and House exchanged knowing looks. House gave one nod to the batter, a thank you. The batter gave one nod back.</p><p>Parting Schotz swung at the first pitch from Little Mikey McBrayer, the Redbug pitcher. Finesse forgot her artistic decorum and screamed into the microphone, using the lingo she'd been practicing for two weeks: ''It's a high line drive into the left field! Or right field! A field! It's the outfield! It's going! It's going! It's gone!"</p><p>It was. The Aurora All Stars had won the game and the pageant was over.</p><p>The crowd went wild.</p><p>The dazzle of day was gone. The clangor, the chorus, the perfect band had played out on a spectacular sun-drenched summer afternoon. Katydids sang as everyone packed their picnics, declaring the day a huge success, and realizing that they had been changed, every one of them. Their hearts were bigger. Even Cleebo's heart was bigger. As he and House bumped into each other collecting the bases, Cleebo muttered, ''We beat them Redbugs."</p><p>''We beat 'em every year," said House, who had barely spoken to Cleebo for two weeks.</p><p>''Not like this," said Cleebo, glad for the conversation.</p><p>''Thank goodness," said House.</p><p>And then Cleebo laughed, all the anger drained out of him, which made House laugh, which made Cleebo apologize.</p><p>And when everyone had gone home, the empty lot was left with the echoes of the history that had been made there. Hanging in the thick summer air was the symphony true, the mingling of every living thing, every heart, every mind, every memory. Mr. Norwood Boyd would have been proud.</p>

</div>
<div id="page5"><p>Mr. Norwood Rhinehart Beauregard Boyd, age 88, philanthropist, philosopher, and maker of mystery, left a will. He wrote the will seven years before he died. The witnesses to his signature were Parting Schotz and Elizabeth Jackson. The will called for the formation of a real Little League team in Aurora County called the Aurora County All Stars. Anyone could play who wanted to play. Anyone. There were to be uniforms, real uniforms, for every player. Mr. Norwood Boyd's home was to be razed to the ground and a baseball field built on the property with real dugouts and benches and bleachers for the fans, real bases, a pitcher's mound, even a snack stand where there would be plenty of cold drinks and hot dogs, plenty of peanuts. There would be plenty of parking as well, and there would even be lights. Mr. Norwood Boyd left money for the construction.</p><p>His will held one last bequest.</p><p>''I bequeath my dog, Eudora Welty, should she still be living at the time of my death, to the Jackson family, from whence she came. As a young dog, Eudora Welty wandered to my house and liked it here. This is how I met her original owner, Elizabeth Jackson. Elizabeth allowed her dog to visit often, and then, finally, she allowed me to adopt Eudora Welty as my companion. It was a loss to young House, who was only 2 years old at the time. I'd like to return Eudora Welty to House with my thanks. The loan of his dog to me has been a joy in my life. She has been a good friend. Perhaps she will befriend House into his adult years."</p><p>She did. When she wasn't befriending Honey.</p><p>How does a boy become a man? And what does he take with him into his old age? House took ''Leaves of Grass" and the memories of the pageant and his days with Mr. Norwood Boyd. He would think back many times on those days of his beginning understanding. It would be too simple to think that his growing up came with the reading or the ball playing. It came with having a dog to love, a sister to protect, a father to sit by his side as he fell asleep, a mother to miss. And there was more.</p><p>House had been transformed by an old man's request, another old man's history, a melodramatic girl who wanted to find herself, and a friend who loved him but who betrayed his confidence.</p><p>And there was beauty in all of it, the grime and the glory alike. Even Cleebo's betrayal had been part of the beauty. It had brought words for House to say, beautiful words. And finding the beauty made all the difference. For words were a symphony, too, written or spoken or sung, and words had made the difference for House. They had opened his mind. His heart. His life.</p><p>Words were his gift from Mr. Norwood Boyd. They gave him the courage it takes to make the leap from boy to man.<img
