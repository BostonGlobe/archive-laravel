</div>

<div id="articleGraphs">
<div id="page1"><p>It was a standoff.</p><p>As House stood there crimping the hose, dying to spray Finesse, the image of Mr. Norwood Rhinehart Beauregard Boyd lying on the cold metal table at Snowberger's Funeral Home, dead, without his glasses, maybe without his clothes, covered with a white sheet, floated into his mind. He shook his head to clear it.</p><p>Finesse shook her head back at House.</p><p>Then -- <em>cruuuunch! </em>The sound of tires crunching pebbles on the dirt road diverted everyone's attention. Bunch Snowberger drove his black hearse right up to the empty lot behind the school, right up to the pageant players.</p><p>House's heart banged against his ribcage. They were coming for him. They would ask him a bunch of questions. Everybody would know what he'd been up to the past year. He clutched harder at the kink in the hose to make sure he didn't let it get away from him.</p><p>Bunch got out of the car just as the back door opened and out stepped Finesse's great-grandfather, Parting Schotz. He was short, a feature that had led everyone in town to call him Pip all his life. He was old, with shiny black eyes, a sprinkle of gray hair, and skin the color of the pine cones that dotted the forest floor. He was wearing his barber apron; he had come straight from work at his shop on Main Street across from Miss Mattie's mercantile.</p><p>House stared in confusion. His mind wouldn't work, he couldn't form a thought.</p><p>''Poppy?" Finesse asked. Her face was a mixture of relief and distress.</p><p>Pip grabbed Finesse's elbows with his slender, strong hands and gave off one great shudder-sob, then gestured toward the hearse.</p><p>''Come on, Sugar," he said. ''We need the family together now."</p><p>Finesse was in the car with her great-grandfather before you could say, ''What happened?" Bunch closed the door behind them, then got back in the car and drove away.</p><p>House was lightheaded from not breathing. He gulped in a great wad of thick summer air.</p><p>''Wow!" said Dove as she watched the hearse disappear. ''That was some getaway."</p><p>''Somebody's dead," said Ruby. ''That's Snowberger's hearse."</p><p>''It's got to be kin to Finesse," said Melba.</p><p>''That could be a hundred people around here," said Ruby.</p><p>Dove looked up from her scribbling. ''Could it be Dr. Dan Deavers?"</p><p>''Somebody run to Miss Mattie's store and find out who died," said Melba.</p><p>''I'll do it," said Ruby, and ran across the empty lot toward the row of town stores on Main Street.</p><p>House began to cough. He unkinked the hose and let the water spray into the dust, stuck his face into the stream of cold water, then shook the wetness from his head.</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>''Who wants a drink?" he asked in a flat voice. Finally. He could speak.</p><p>Kids approached House cautiously, then milled around the hose, drinking or waiting for a turn. They were hot, cranky, and confused. Honey snored on.</p><p>''Are we practicing or not, House?" asked Cleebo.</p><p>''It's too hot," said House. He handed the hose to Cleebo.</p><p>''What about after supper?" Cleebo asked. He slurped a long drink from the hose.</p><p>''Can't," said House. ''I got plans."</p><p>Cleebo spit into the dirt and wiped a wet hand across his face.</p><p>''When ain't you got plans lately? It's not like we got a million games to play. This one is it! You wanna beat them Redbugs or what?"</p><p>''We'll beat 'em," said House. He picked up his sleeping sister. She tucked her head under her brother's chin. ''I gotta take Honey home." Home. He'd go home. He'd go home and stay there until he could get back inside Mr. Norwood Boyd's home. Eudora Welty lapped at a pool of water near the hose.</p><p>''Hey!" came a shout from across the lot. Ruby was on her way back. ''I know who it is!" she hollered. She stopped in front of the kids, took the hose from Cleebo, and drank as if she were dying of thirst. Then she made her announcement, water dripping off her chin, her eyes wide in astonishment. ''It's Mr. Norwood Boyd. Mean Man Boyd! Can you believe it? I didn't even know he was still alive!"</p><p>The news buzzed around the group of children. House waited to see if there would be a mention of him being present at Mr. Norwood Boyd's bedside.</p><p>''Are you sure?" asked Melba. ''Finesse can't be related to him!"</p><p>''How do you know?" said Ruby.</p><p>Dove scribbled in her notebook. ''Who is Mr. Norwood Boyd?"</p><p>Ruby spoke with the same energetic rhythm she was using to turn off the hose: ''Meanest man who ever drew a breath of life."</p><p>''Richest, too," said Cleebo, a glint in his eye. ''I hear he's hoarded trunks full of treasure in that old rat-trap of a house of his, from all them years he traveled all over the world." Cleebo began to rub his hands together in a greedy gesture but shoved them into his pockets instead and stared, bug-eyed, at the kids. ''Treasure! Just sittin' there, waiting for somebody to come find it."</p><p>The others nodded. It was a well-worn tale. Mr. Norwood Boyd the Merchant Marine who came back from his world travels only to hole up in his house for the past 20 years -- alone.</p><p>House's stomach did a flip-flop. He whistled for Eudora. Honey woke up and rubbed her eyes. She was sticky with sweat.</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>''Why is he the meanest man?" asked Dove.</p><p>''He kidnapped kids and they were never heard from again!" said one kid.</p><p>''He ate 'em!" said another.</p><p>''That's ridiculous," said Dove. ''He couldn't get away with that."</p><p>''Oh yes he could!" said Cleebo. ''And did! For years! How do you think he got food to eat? The ghosts of all those dead kids he kidnapped still live in that old place, and there's tons of 'em. He's hundreds of years old and just keeps coming back to life every time he dies!"</p><p>''Stop it!" shouted House. He put Honey down. She buried her face in his leg.</p><p>''What do you care?" asked Cleebo. ''You know somethin' we don't?"</p><p>House cleared his throat. ''You're scaring Honey."</p><p>Honey nodded. Her tutu was crushed on one side.</p><p>Across the empty lot, walking with a purposeful gait, came Miss Mattie Perkins. She wore a store apron and had her hair pinned into a no-nonsense bun on the back of her head.</p><p>''What's happening here?" she asked. ''Is it a convention?"</p><p>''I was just tellin' them about Mr. Norwood Boyd," said Ruby.</p><p>''I figured you were," said Miss Mattie. She put her hands on her hips, pursed her lips, and stared at everyone until they fidgeted. ''Time to go home, all of you," she said. ''There will be practice here in the morning, 10 o'clock sharp, for every name on the pageant list." Her gaze speared each ballplayer's face and they each looked away from her.</p><p>''Remember," she said, ''if your parents signed you up, you show up. The pageant will go on as scheduled, on July Fourth." No one protested to Miss Mattie. ''Now, go home," she said. ''It's too hot to be out here in the sun."</p><p>''Miss Mattie," said Melba. ''Is Mr. Norwood Boyd kin to Finesse -- er, Frances?"</p><p>Miss Mattie took a breath, retied the strings on her apron and said, ''Mr. Norwood Boyd had no family." She let her breath out slowly. ''Rest his soul."</p><p>House's eyes filled with tears. The thought of crying in front of everyone horrified him. He took a deep breath and held it.</p><p>''Then why . . ." Ruby began.</p><p>''How did he die?" asked Dove in her most respectful voice.</p><p>''I don't know, child," said Miss Mattie. ''But we'll soon find out all about it."</p><p>House's knees buckled beneath him. He sank like a ship and landed in the dirt, just missing Eudora Welty.</p><p>''What's wrong with you, House?" asked Miss Mattie.</p><p>House blinked and licked his lips. ''Hot," he said.</p><p>''He's out of his head with heat," said Cleebo hastily. ''I'll get him home." He took off his baseball cap and fanned at House. ''C'mon, buddy. Let's go."</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>Cleebo helped House to his feet, took Honey by the hand, and whistled for Eudora Welty. ''That's the ugliest dog I ever saw," he said. Eudora wagged her stumpy tail.</p><p>The baseball team disbanded and kids wandered home. Ruby, Melba, and Dove walked back to the mercantile with Miss Mattie. The empty lot was left to the grasshoppers and lengthening shadows of late afternoon.</p><p>The dirt road that led from Hallelujah to Mabel, Miss., ran through the deserted countryside. Cleebo, House, Honey, and Eudora Welty walked down the middle of it.</p><p>''What're we gonna do about the game, House?" asked Cleebo.</p><p>''I don't know," said House in a distracted voice.</p><p>''We can't change the day," said Cleebo, waving his arms to get House's attention. ''It's always July Fourth. That's the onliest day the Redbugs can come!"</p><p>''We'll think of something," said House. He stared at the road in front of him and watched his feet take each step.</p><p>''Where'd your new dog come from?" asked Cleebo.</p><p>''Found her in the bushes," said House.</p><p>''I love her!" said Honey. ''Her name is You-doggie!"</p><p>House smiled at her. ''Eudora," he said.</p><p>''That's what I said," said Honey. ''You-doggie!"</p><p>Honey and Eudora Welty began trailing behind and House let them. ''Sorry about practice," he said to Cleebo.</p><p>''Don't matter," said Cleebo. ''You got other things on your mind, I can tell."</p><p>They'd walked almost a mile when Cleebo stopped and said, ''Looka here."</p><p>House looked up from studying his footsteps. They were passing Mr. Norwood Boyd's home. The house was shut up tight and looked the same as always except for the kudzu vines strewn across the yard where the driveway gates had been forced open. The afternoon shadows were long now; they bathed the place in mystery.</p><p>''Sorry about what I said," said Cleebo, gesturing to the house.</p><p>''Don't matter," said House.</p><p>''You two close?" asked Cleebo.</p><p>House looked sideways at Cleebo. ''Nah."</p><p>''But you knew him," said Cleebo. ''I can tell."</p><p>House shook his head. ''Nah."</p><p>''Yeah, you did," said Cleebo. ''It got to you, all that talk about him dyin' and who he was."</p><p>Honey and Eudora Welty approached them. Honey was humming a nothing tune. Eudora snuffled along with Honey until she got close to Mr. Norwood Boyd's front gate. Then, like a homing pigeon recognizing her roost, her ears perked up and she began running like a little white barrel wearing a pink tutu. She ran straight for Mr. Norwood Boyd's front porch.</p><p>''Eudora!" called House. He ran after her with Cleebo on his heels.</p><p>''Don't go in there, House!" screamed Honey.</p><p>House stopped at the gate. ''Eudora!" he called. The dog was gone. ''I've got to go in and get her, Honey," he said.</p><p>''No! There's ghosts in there!" cried Honey.</p><p>''There's no such thing," said House. ''That's just a story. . ."</p><p>''Nooooo!" Honey began to cry. She leaned forward and wailed for Eudora. ''You-doggie!"</p><p>Cleebo was at House's elbow, speaking in a quick, low voice.</p><p>''I see where that dog comes from," he said. ''And I know you know somethin'."</p><p>Cleebo touched House's arm and House wrenched it away from Cleebo.</p><p>''You can tell me," said Cleebo, a mixture of awe and fear in his voice. ''What did you do to him? Did you find the treasure?"<img
