<b>THE STORY SO FAR:</b> <i>It is 1803, and as the French emperor Napoleon conquers much of Europe, people in England fear their island nation will be next. Jim's father moves his family north to Scotland. A man calling himself ''the fox" tells the family to go to the Headless Piper inn in the village of Glenard. There, the innkeeper, Mr. Campbell, tends to Jim's father, who has become quite ill. Jim's mother goes back to England, and Jim stays at the inn to work for Mr. Campbell. Jim is frightened by strange sounds coming from the dunes, called the Culbin Sands, and by the stories Mr. Campbell tells about the ghosts of drowned sailors who come to the inn at night. Then, strange things start to happen. One morning, a wrecked ship, thought to be French, washes up on the beach, empty, with no sign of the sailors. Another day, Mr. Campbell asks Jim to brush out a perfectly clean and unused chimney, and then takes a lantern to the beach, flashes signals at a far-off ship, and watches the ship turn and sail away. The ''Headless Piper" sign on the door of the inn frequently becomes crooked for no apparent reason. Jim discovers a secret tunnel leading from the stable to the basement of the inn, where he hears a man speaking French and starts to think Mr. Campbell is actually helping the French. That night, Jim  walks up into the Culbin Sands. He falls through the chimney of an old mansion that has been covered in sand and finds a group of men speaking French. They are bringing in gold through a passageway from the sea. When he is discovered, Jim picks up a sword and tries to fence with one of the Frenchmen, who says his name is ''La Fosse." He is the same man whom Jim and his family had met earlier, who they thought was ''the fox."</i></p><table

<p>
La Fosse was trying to kill me. His sword flashed, and his eyes gleamed. Then he crossed my blade with his, reached out his left hand, and snatched away my rapier.</p>

<p>
''Farewell, English boy," he said, drawing back his arm for the final thrust. But Mr. Campbell shouted, ''Stop! It's gone far enough."</p>

<p>
''The boy insulted me," cried the Frenchman.</p>

<p>
''He meant nothing, I'm sure." Mr. Campbell came up to his side. ''I beg you; spare him for France."</p>

<p>
''For France?" asked La Fosse.</p>

<p>
''His father will pay a handsome reward."</p>

<p>
My father was penniless, and Mr. Campbell knew it well. But with this small lie, my life was spared, and La Fosse threw his sword aside.</p>

<p>
''Very well," said he. ''Perhaps the Empress Josephine will make a pet of him."</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell nodded, then turned and shouted in French, ''Prenez le gar&#xE7;on &#xE0; bord et mettez le dans la cabine des plongeurs" -- Take the boy onboard and put him in the divers' cabin.</p>

<p>
Three sailors marched me onto the undersea vessel, and into its hull through a hatch.</p>

<p>
It was like stepping into a palace, though a very narrow one. Every wall was paneled with rosewood. There were round windows with velvet curtains, and elaborate carved scrolls, all lit by lamps in the shapes of fishes and seashells. I was led to the plainest space of all. Though still richly paneled, its ceiling was bare, and across it ran a maze of brass pipes. From numerous hooks and pegs hung the pieces of diving contraptions --  heads and arms and bodies -- giving the room the appearance of a monstrous slaughtering house.</p>

<p>
There was one window, but I had no hope of escaping through it. The size of a dinner plate, it had no hinges or clasps, but only a round pane 3 inches thick.</p>

<p>
There was a bench in the middle of the room, and there I sat as the loading went on. The brass pipes began to hum and bang as water pulsed through them. Then the steam engine started huffing, and tremors ran through the hull.</p>

<p>
A long time later, there came the shrill whistling of a bosun's call. I heard the hatches being sealed. Then, amid a snap and creak of cable, we began sliding toward the Firth in a series of jarring jolts. The diving helmets nodded from their hooks. The canvas arms waved, and the bodies danced clumsy jigs on their spindly legs.</p>

<p>
I moved to the window as we slid into the tunnel. I watched the water rise over the hull and cover the glass, then felt the shift in weight as we came afloat. A change in sounds told me the fires had been put out beneath the boilers, and that a smaller engine was running on the head of steam. We moved more smoothly then, and soon emerged from the tunnel to settle on the sandy floor of the Firth. The small engine shut down, and we lay there in eerie silence. In the light cast from the windows, I saw scuttling crabs and fishes swimming about.</p>

<p>
Then from the darkness came three divers, passing my window in strange slow-motion. They traveled two yards in a step, landing with a puff of sand from their boots, to leap again with their arms swinging just as slowly. After they had passed from my view, I heard the most tremendous rush of air and water, and a clanking of metal doors. Then the small steam engine began thumping again, and we rose slowly from the sand.</p>

<p>
There was much stamping beyond my door. The key turned, and in came the divers, with seaweed snared around their heavy boots. Mr. Campbell followed them in. He closed the door, then said to me, ''Well, it's nearly over, Jim. For better or worse."</p>

<p>
''Better or <em>worse</em>?" I cried. ''What could possibly be for the better?"</p>

<p>
''Time will tell," said he.</p>

<p>
Mr. Campbell helped the divers remove their contraptions. He unbuckled the helmets and lifted them off, unbuckled the arms and the legs. The Frenchmen babbled away.</p>

<p>
''They're a wonder, these suits," said Mr. Campbell. ''These men would have drowned in an instant without them."</p>

<p>
''I wish they had," said I. ''And you as well, Mr. Campbell."</p>

<p>
He looked truly surprised. ''Now, Jim, I saved your life, did I not?"</p>

<p>
''I don't wish to talk to you," said I, turning my back toward him.</p>

<p>
''Ah, there's fine thanks," he said. ''You're powerless to change a thing, so you might as well make the best of it."</p>

<p>
I watched the sandy floor of the Firth go by. We passed right above the wreck of a galleon, and I saw the barrels of cannons, the stumps of old ribs, the ground all mined away. There was an enormous bell resting on the wreck, and we barely cleared its top as we floated on and up. A few feet of old rope hung from the bell, surely the bitter end of the broken cable I'd seen streaming from the stranded ship.</p>

<p>
By the time Mr. Campbell and the divers left, the vessel was moving swiftly. I could feel it pulsing along, though it neither rocked nor rolled. I stood and dressed myself in one of the diving contraptions.</p>

<p>
''Powerless?" I said aloud. ''We'll see about that."</p>

<p>
The buckles proved the most awkward business, once my hands were encased in the heavy sleeves and gloves. But I managed them all. The vessel began to pitch with the waves, rolling gently at first, and then farther as we came to the surface. The larger steam engine was started, and when I heard the banging of water in the pipes I smiled and said, ''Yes, we'll see."</p>

<p>
In boots that weighed 40 pounds or more, I staggered across the room, reached up, and took hold of one of the pipes. I hung all my weight onto it, and all the weight of the diving suit. It creaked and bent, but didn't break.</p>

<p>
I saw the empty legs of the diving suits kicking from their hooks, and gathered them all, with their massive shoes attached. I wrapped them around the pipe, three-hundredweight of lead or more, and added my own again. The metal strained. It stretched and burst.</p>

<p>
The force of the water took me by surprise. It blasted against my helmet and sent me reeling back. I tumbled to the deck, then struggled up as water filled the room.</p>

<p>
Alarms rang through the vessel. Voices shouted. ''Que Dieu nous aide! Nous coulons" -- God help us! We are sinking. Then into my room stormed Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>
''Jim!" he shouted. ''What do you think you're doing?"</p>

<p>
''Sinking your ship," said I. ''Saving England."</p>

<p>
''You fool," he said. ''You'll drown us all."</p>

<p>
Water was roaring from the pipe, blasting clear across the room. The rosewood panels splintered from the wall, and the arms of the diving suits gestured madly in the spray. Through the glass of my helmet I saw terror in Mr. Campbell's eyes.</p>

<p>
''What did I do to deserve this?" he asked.</p>

<p>
''You lied about everything," I said. ''You made a traitor of me, Mr. Campbell. A traitor like yourself."</p>

<p>
He looked with horror at the rising water. ''All right, it's true," he said. ''But I'm a traitor to the <em>French</em>!" He pointed at the ceiling. ''It's the British fleet that's waiting. I'm a double agent, Jim."</p>

<p>
A second pipe collapsed, and the water came in a deluge. In a moment it covered the floor to the depths of our ankles.</p>

<p>
He had taken us in and treated us well, and I had brought ruin to everything.</p>

<p>
''I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell," I said. ''Say you forgive me."</p>

<p>
''Never mind that," said he. ''The ship's lost, but we can save ourselves. Help me into a suit."</p>

<p>
Lord knows I tried. Mr. Campbell stepped into one of the barrel bodies and pulled a helmet over his head. We worked together at the buckles as the water rose above our knees, above our waists, as the ship went down. We searched frantically for a pair of leggings and boots.</p>

<p>
''Where are they?" shouted Mr. Campbell, thrashing through the water.</p>

<p>
The lamps went out, and in the darkness below the sea, in the cold and utter dark, Mr. Campbell took hold of me.</p>

<p>
''Give me yours!" he shouted, pulling at my feet. I tried to kick him away, but the leggings tore loose from their straps. Mr. Campbell peeled them away as the vessel slanted steeply.</p>

<p>
I felt it falling through the sea, and Mr. Campbell and I, and all the pieces of the suits, tumbled in a mass across the room. Voices called in French for help: ''Aidez-moi! Oh, mis&#xE9;ricorde!" -- Help me! Oh, mercy! And the vessel plummeted down. It smashed against the sea floor, and the hull cracked open like an egg.</p>

<p>
I was blasted through the hole in a bubble of air. I saw the vessel, all shadowy and green, spouting air from hatches and vents. Then, buoyed by the suit, I broke through the surface, to a sea that was rough and wild.</p>

<p>
A mass of strange flotsam appeared around me. Up came an admiral's hat and a writing quill, a snuff box, a boot-stretcher, a carved wooden goose. It all bobbed on the wild waves that tumbled me sideways and head-over-heels. My suit filled with water, and I tore away the helmet for fear of drowning inside it. Then I floated in the canvas shell, shot like a cork to the crest of each wave.</p>

<p>
I saw the squadron of warships. Close-reefed and hoved to, they bucked into the seas with pennants streaming. From their sterns flapped great flags of red, white and blue: the tricolor, the striped emblem of France.</p>

<p>
So Mr. Campbell had tried to fool me once again. But I found no joy in the thought that I had bettered him. I remembered his smiling face, his cries of pleasure just to see me. I had saved England, but lost a friend.</p>

<p>
It seemed like hours until the storm washed me ashore. The sun was setting, and the French squadron had fled to the east. The first breaker hurled me onto the sand. The second sucked me back, and I tumbled in the surf until the wooden shell broke apart around me. Then I dragged myself from the sea, and trudged toward the village.</p>

<p>
I arrived late in the night, a full day and a half since my leaving. Everyone asked of me, ''Where's Campbell? What's happened to Campbell?" I kept my silence on that score, and no one believed the rest of my tale. As far as my father, or anyone else, was concerned, I'd only been playing truant in the Sands.</p>

<p>
A wealth of small things washed ashore, and the village flocked down to find them.</p>

<p>
As for my father and me, we stayed on at the Headless Piper. My mother came back from England, and the three of us made a go of running the old inn. All of Glenard thought it was for the best.</p>

<p>
''Och, ye were as close to a son as old Campbell ever had," said Strawberry Nose. ''It micht as well be that  Sassenachs keep runnin' it, pending the return o' Campbell, o' course."</p>

<p>
A year later -- a year to the day -- we were still there, and still ''pending the return of Campbell." That night, I had a great shock when Daft Willy wandered past the open door of the parlor.</p>

<p>
Strawberry Nose and the McDonalds hardly looked up from the table.</p>

<p>
''Why, it's as though I've seen a ghost," I said.</p>

<p>
A laugh came from John Donald McDonald. ''Well, o' course ye have, Jim," said he. ''How long's it been since Daft Willy got kicked by that horse?"</p>

<p>
''Twenty years, if a day," said Strawberry Nose.</p>

<p>
''Get awa', ye bodach!" cried Donald John McDonald. ''Daft Willy's been a ghost as long as I remember."</p>
