<p>
&quot;I had this problem that took me many years to solve,&quot; she said in the canvas-cluttered studio of her husband, painter Robert Caputo. &quot;I was never good material for the kind of job where you don't want to think about what you have to think about all day.&quot; Fortunately, this problem made possible her just-published novel, &quot;Inheritance,&quot; a tale of China and America, of war within nations and families.</p>


<p>
Following her short-story collection, &quot;Hunger,&quot; Chang spent seven years toting her developing novel around the country, from one teaching job or fellowship to another, trying to make it whole. Starting in Palo Alto, Calif., at Stanford, she moved to Iowa City to teach at the Writer's Workshop, then to a fellowship at Princeton, followed by a monthlong fellowship in Wyoming, then a Radcliffe fellowship at Harvard, back to Iowa City, and finally back to Cambridge, where she holds the Briggs-Copeland lectureship in creative writing at Harvard. After long labor, the novel is out of the writer, between covers, in bookstores.</p>


<p>
&quot;Inheritance&quot; covers a period from 1925 to 1993 and concerns a tragic division between two sisters, Junan and Yinan. The 1937 Japanese invasion of China separates Junan, the elder sister, from her husband, an officer evacuated with Nationalist forces to the western interior. In contact with him by telegraph, Junan begs him to let her take their daughters and join him, but he refuses. Desperate to maintain some kind of contact, she sends her artistic younger sister to him, with grievous consequences that reverberate across time, generations, and immigration to the United States.</p>


<p>
Before she could write freely and publish, Chang (known as &quot;Sam&quot;) had to solve her &quot;problem&quot; -- that she could not embrace a secure, stable, relatively predictable field such as medicine or law. Her three sisters -- a doctor, a lawyer, and a physical therapist -- did so, but she was cut from different cloth. &quot;At a certain point, I had to rebel,&quot; she said. &quot;I kept it a secret for a long time. I had this desire to be normal, to slide under the wire, escape scrutiny, get the kind of job where you wear pantyhose and go to work.&quot;</p>


<p>
Her parents, born in China, had endured the violence and privation of the Japanese occupation, followed by civil war. They moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Communists took over in 1949, and both eventually came to the United States: her mother to attend Mount Mercy College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; her father to go to graduate school in chemical engineering at Columbia University. They met in New York, married, and moved to Appleton, Wis., near Green Bay, where her father took a job with a research institute affiliated with Lawrence University. Lan Samantha, the third child, was born there.</p>


<p>
As she and her sisters grew up, Chang said, their parents &quot;sacrificed an enormous amount so that we could become financially and professionally secure.&quot; Still, for Chang there was &quot;the problem.&quot;</p>


<p>
&quot;They wanted me to become a doctor,&quot; she said. &quot;I remember listening to their views on it for years, then going to first grade and realizing that I didn't like math and science as much as I liked reading. And I knew that I wanted to be a writer from the time I was 4. There was not much else I wanted to do. But I didn't tell them. I remember saying I liked math and science, because I knew that would make them happy. Then I went to college and realized there was no way I wanted to do any of the things I was supposed to do.</p>


<p>
&quot;I applied to colleges,&quot; Chang said, &quot;and wrote in my applications that I wanted to be a dermatologist, because I once had a rash and knew what a dermatologist was. I didn't want to be a dermatologist, but I thought I could bend my mind and do something I didn't want to do.&quot;</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead">Facing `the problem'</span><br>Chang went to Yale, and when she admitted to herself that she couldn't bear to study chemistry or math, she changed her major to East Asian studies, which she says was acceptable to her parents. She worked on the Yale Daily News, eventually becoming managing editor. Journalism was respectable, she says, and would have met with parental approval. But she did not think it was right for her: daily deadlines, calling strangers. After graduation in 1987, she took the Law School Admission Test -- &quot;because if I wasn't going to medical school, my parents wanted me to go to law school. But the test made me realize I had no desire to think the way the LSAT made me think.&quot;</p>


<p>
After two years as an editorial assistant for a publisher, she was accepted at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, a two-year program in public administration. &quot;I came to the Kennedy School,&quot; she said, &quot;filled with hopes that maybe I had found a way to work in the world as a functional and productive human being, and within a semester I came face to face with the problem. The school was filled with wonderful, intelligent, well-meaning people who wanted to affect the world in a positive way. There would be assignments such as, `Read this story about the Detroit debt crisis of 1978 and write a two-page memo solving the problem.' I realized that I didn't like answering problems, but I did like describing problems.&quot;</p>


<p>
Which is, she knew, what writers do.</p>


<p>
&quot;Writers don't answer questions about the world,&quot; Chang said. &quot;They ask questions. Tolstoy believed there was a right and a wrong, but his characters were not one or the other. They were always struggling.&quot;</p>


<p>
She decided to give writing a chance and took a fiction-writing workshop at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education, in the spring semester of 1990, her first year at the Kennedy School. She loved it and took another workshop in the summer, while her Kennedy School classmates were taking internships in governments or public agencies. In her second year, she said, &quot;every morning I would get up and write for three hours, then do my schoolwork. It was a wonderful time. I had this screen of being a respectable student in a respectable program.&quot;</p>


<p>
After graduating from the Kennedy School in 1991, she applied to the Iowa Writer's Workshop and was accepted.</p>


<p>
&quot;It was the best thing I ever did,&quot; she said. &quot;My teachers were wonderful. It was such a luxury to have time to think about my writing, and to be with other writers.&quot; Her parents &quot;were skeptical,&quot; she says, but did not fight her, thinking she would get it out of her system. She graduated in 1993 and went to Stanford, where she lived and wrote the stories that became &quot;Hunger.&quot; In 2000, during her Radcliffe fellowship, she met painter and art teacher Robert Caputo.</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead">Making her parents proud</span><br>Chang's love and respect for her parents is obvious, and she makes clear that they were not opposed to the study of humanities.  Her mother was a piano teacher,  and Chang showed such talent for the violin that her parents thought she might follow a music career. Most of all, with roots in such a tumultuous world as prewar China, they wanted stability and security for their daughters. Chang had been an excellent student, valedictorian of her high school class, and many career choices seemed open to her. In a telephone interview, Chang's parents said they knew she had the talent and desire to write but that the writer's life was fraught with uncertainty.</p>


<p>
&quot;It worried us,&quot; said her mother, Helen Chung-Hung Hsiang, &quot;because in any area of art, you need an audience. You don't really know what type of work will make an audience like you. There were other ways to make a living that might be more secure.&quot;</p>


<p>
Her father, Nai-Lin Chang, added: &quot;We did worry. I definitely was always concerned about the future of my kids. Even in the Iowa program, not all the graduates are successful.&quot;</p>


<p>
Yet they hasten to say they are proud of their daughter, of her talent, what she has accomplished, and of her determination and willingness to work hard. &quot;I admire her ability to make up stories, to make them real,&quot; said her mother. &quot;Sam somehow can always capture the audience.&quot;</p>


<p>
Lan Samantha Chang has been a writer long enough not to have illusions. &quot;Now that I'm actually a writer,&quot; she said, &quot;and I realize how uncertain the life is, how difficult writing is, I understand why my parents were worried. I'm doing OK right now, and I have a steady job. But the process of writing this book makes me realize how terribly hard it is. I threw away 400 pages, rewrote it 14 times, moved four or five times, and most of the moves were solely to get funding to write the book. It was exhausting and isolating. I put my life into the book for seven years, and now it's out, and it's going to be on a shelf as long as a carton of yogurt. The book business is terrible and terrifying.&quot; Nevertheless, she said, &quot;I love writing, and more than that, I don't know how to do anything else.&quot;</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead">Realistic expectations</span><br>At the center of &quot;Inheritance&quot; is the beautiful, principled, and tragically implacable Junan. It is narrated by one of her daughters, who suffers her mother's pain yet only partially comprehends it. She longs for understanding and reconciliation and goes back to China in search of it.</p>


<p>
&quot;One of the things I learned while writing it,&quot; Chang said, &quot;is that we are all living in our own pocket of time, in our own bodies, and are in that way isolated from people who are traveling in different times, different bodies. There is this intense need to reach outside of ourselves, to love and forgive and be alive with other human beings. At the same time, there is the inability of somebody to understand a person from another time. You can't pass your life along. You can try, but everybody has to learn by themselves.&quot;</p>


<p>
Committed as she is to the literary life, Chang tries to help her students be realistic in their expectations. She said, &quot;I usually tell them to keep trying to write as much as they can. If they need it in their lives, they will know.&quot;</p>


<p>
Her own needs are clear and focused: &quot;I want to write something large and beautiful. I want to have a family. Teaching is an important part of my life. As a writer, what I would really like to do is become better and better, wiser and wiser, see and understand more and more. Become more subtle and complex and ruthless. That's the hardest part.&quot;</p>
