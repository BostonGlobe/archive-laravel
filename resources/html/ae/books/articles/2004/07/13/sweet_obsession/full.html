<p>
SOMERVILLE -- If a man's eyes are the windows to his soul, his apartment walls are the peephole to his personality. At a glance, Steve Almond's are typical of those found in the humble but compelling dwellings of the poorly paid creative class: poems taped to the moldings, snapshots of ironic rock bands, Chinese fortunes, odd news clippings, indecipherable scraps that mean nothing to a stranger. But the curious stranger discovers a deeper strata of decorative paperwork. An assortment of scathing teacher evaluations that most Boston College adjunct professors would opt to keep in a locked file cabinet. Some very personal correspondence. And a whole lot of candy wrappers.</p>

<p>
The swaths of squares and rectangles that ornament his home say a lot about Steve Almond -- namely that he's serious, shameless, and a little weird, as a writer and as a human being. This isn't news to readers of Almond's 2002 collection of short stories, &quot;My Life in Heavy Metal,&quot; a sharp, tender excavation of modern love that's memorable for much more than the incredibly tactile descriptions of sex and that established him as something of a bard -- the following statistic is Almond's -- to the<br/></p>


<p>
fraction of the fraction of the 1 percent of the population that actually reads short stories.  Happily, there's a lot of licking and sucking and biting in his new book, too. Here's an excerpt:</p>


<p>
&quot;There was a sense of the piece yielding to the mouth. By which I mean, one had to work the teeth through the sturdy chocolate shell, which gave way with a distinct, moist snap, through the crisped rice (thus releasing a second, grainy bouquet), and only then into the soft caramel core. Oh, that inimitable combination of textures! That symphony of flavors! And how they offered themselves to heat and wetness of the mouth. . . .&quot;</p>


<p>
That's Almond's memory of eating a Caravelle bar, the inexplicable disappearance of which sparked a coast-to-coast candy-factory odyssey, a bittersweet voyage back to his childhood, and a new book called &quot;Candyfreak: A Journey Through the Chocolate Underbelly of America,&quot; published this spring by Algonquin.</p>


<p>
Part personal memoir and part cultural history, &quot;Candyfreak&quot; is the work of an obsessive. Almond eats candy every day, and has done so as far back as he can remember. There are boxes of Kit Kat Darks stacked precariously in his refrigerator and brown bags filled with Cookies 'n' Mint in the back of his bedroom closet. Bowls are heaped with samples from a recent trip to the All Candy Expo in Chicago, and there's more stuffed in office drawers and kitchen cupboards. A tour of Almond's apartment turns up approximately 50 pounds of candy. As he calculates this astonishing number, as if on cue, a Federal Express delivery man knocks on the door.</p>


<p>
&quot;A lot of people are sending stuff,&quot; says Almond, who lets a few moans escape as he pries open a box of Colts Bolts and Happy Trails chocolates from Nashville. Almond, 37, hit the genetic jackpot when it comes to metabolism. No matter what he consumes, his rangy physique refuses to expand. &quot;I think everybody has a little bit of freak in them about candy.  It's such a nostalgia trigger. It's the first economic empowerment for kids, your first forbidden pleasure, and there are a lot of people who continue to love candy but in a closeted way, because it's childish. I'm exceptional. Most people aren't this into it.&quot;</p>


<p>
This may be true, but to judge by the number of people fessing up on the Freak Testify! board at Almond's website (www.candy<br/></p>


<p>
freak.com), there's a whole lot of coming out going on. Candyfreaks or not, readers are gobbling up the book, which has sold 50,000 copies since its April release and is about to go into a third printing. &quot;I started having flashbacks about Marathon bars while I was reading the manuscript,&quot; says Michael Taekens, publicity director at Algonquin. &quot;I knew we had something unique. There was a buzz building in the house, and then we started getting amazing feedback from booksellers who we'd sent galleys to. We also sent out a ton of candy. Things started clicking from the very beginning.&quot;</p>


<p>
The history of candy is the history of America, argues Almond, whose work has been anthologized in &quot;The Pushcart Prize,&quot; &quot;Zoetrope,&quot; and &quot;The Best American Erotica,&quot; among others; he's also a regular commentator on WBUR-FM (90.9), Boston's NPR affiliate. &quot;Candyfreak&quot; lovingly chronicles candy's boom years in this country -- when hundreds of regional factories cranked out such small-town delights as the Twin Bing, the Idaho Spud, and the Goo Goo Cluster -- and the little guys' struggle for survival in the shadows of the big three modern candy conglomerates: Hershey's, Mars, and <org idsrc="other-OTC" value="NSRGF;NSRGY">Nestle</org>. Into this, Almond weaves his own candy history, an equally sorry narrative of a boy who formed an emotional bond -- ritualized, fetishized, and deep -- with Lifesavers and Jolly Ranchers instead of his remote parents and antagonistic older brother.</p>


<p>
&quot;It's the revenge of the therapists' children,&quot; says Rick Almond, Steve's father, of the book. Both Rick and his wife, Barbara, are psychiatrists in Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;All of our children have been very honest and direct with us. We think it's wonderful.&quot;</p>


<p>
Almond &quot;hightailed it&quot; out of Palo Alto as soon as he graduated from high school. After earning a degree in English at Wesleyan he took a job as music critic and features reporter at the El Paso Times. From there Almond did a tour of duty as an investigative reporter at a Miami weekly, where he discovered that he was entirely without investigative reporting skills.</p>


<p>
&quot;I'd get hung up on, `Why is this lawyer self-destructing? What's going on inside of him?' So I finally decided to go to grad school in North Carolina for an MFA. Sometimes you listen to your gut. Sometimes you don't. I listened to my gut in writing this book. I almost didn't do it because I didn't think I could work on something that sounds on the face of it as silly and gimmicky as writing a book about candy. It was a close call.&quot;</p>


<p>
Almond, who moved to Boston in 1997, no longer counts or collates or stages elaborate little battles with his candy. He does, however, notice a pattern to his candy consumption -- basically, he eats it when he's feeling really bad or really good -- and it was during a particularly pronounced episode of the former that the seeds for &quot;Candyfreak&quot; were planted.</p>


<p>
&quot;I had started a novel right after `Heavy Metal' came out and spent a year and a half working on it, and it failed,&quot; Almond says. &quot;I was very down about that.  `Heavy Metal' had been a commercial failure, even if it was an artistic success, my agent had fired me and I couldn't find a new one, and nobody wants any more stories anyway. I was bummed and I started eating a lot of candy, and I started returning to the feelings I had as a child when I felt out of sorts and like a failure. I started ideating about candy. I became insufferable at parties, and my friends started saying, `You should write a book about this. You really love it. You really know it.' And I said no, no, no, it's not a serious topic. It's pop. I'm a writer. But I started visiting factories [for a Boston Phoenix article about Boston's candy legacy] and once I started seeing the production I just stopped trying to fight it.&quot;</p>


<p>
&quot;Candyfreak&quot; began as straightforward history of the candy industry. Almond spent many months writing impassioned letters to candy company presidents, flying to places like Merriam, Kan., to watch machines plink liquid chocolate and marshmallow syrup into glazed paper cups at the Sifers factory where against all odds the Valomilk (b. 1931) is still made, and throwing candy-tasting parties for his friends in the hopes of collecting witticisms to use in his book. But in the midst of all this exhaustive research and meticulous reporting Almond sensed a more personal story emerging.</p>


<p>
&quot;I started asking myself, `What does this book have to say other than the history of candy is really interesting?' &quot; Almond says. &quot;It's my part in it. I shook myself down and really let myself think about the cogent memories of my youth, and so many of them radiated around candy. My relationship to my dad and my own loneliness and making candy a kind of companion. I love my family and they know it, but there was this unhappiness, and one of my responses was to latch myself on to candy. My dad's reaction to the book was, `I didn't realize your childhood was that unhappy,' and my response to that was, `Where the hell were you?' &quot;</p>


<p>
Almond is inundated daily with letters and care packages and e-mails from people who can relate. He doesn't feign delighted shock at the success of his quirky  book or the zealous community of candy lovers that's sprouting in its wake, because in his heart of hearts he knew that there was a nerve waiting to be hit and that he was the freak to do it. Almond is reveling in the attention, the readings, the travel, and the delicious opportunity &quot;Candyfreak&quot; has given him to avoid working. But there's a book of short stories due out in the spring. And a collaboration on a novel with the author Julianna Baggott. So amid the accolades and invitations, Almond is freaking on a new idea:  how to force himself back into the cage, reacquaint himself with isolation and self-doubt, and write.</p>


<p>
&quot;It's wonderful when people like your stuff,&quot; Almond says. &quot;But who you really are is at home with this keyboard having a chance to get to the deepest part of whatever your weird, mixed-up feelings are about life. I could keep milking the candy thing. But my job now is to find what I'm obsessive about. Otherwise it's like trying to put fake chocolate in something. It never works.&quot;</p>
