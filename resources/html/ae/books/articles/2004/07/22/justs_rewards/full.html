WEST TISBURY -- It's been a good life for novelist Ward Just, 68. His output has been prodigious, with three collections of short stories, two nonfiction books, a play, and 14 novels, including his just-published &quot;An Unfinished Season.&quot;  His health is good, he has been happily married since 1983, and he is the father of three children and grandfather of four.</p>

<p>
He has what most aspiring writers dream of.  He is always published, gets positive reviews, and is esteemed by his peers, and 12 of his books are still in print. But he has never had a big bestseller or won any of the major literary prizes. &quot;He should have won the Pulitzer half a dozen times,&quot; said novelist Frederick Busch.  Just's biggest book, 1997's &quot;Echo House,&quot; sold close to 40,000 copies in paperback after it became a finalist for the National Book Award. His other books have sold less well.</p>


<p>
Still, in these hard times for literary fiction, Ward Just is a great success story in that he realized a lifelong dream. After making a career as an elite political reporter and war correspondent, he chucked it all to become a man of letters.</p>


<p>
His conversation, punctuated with peals of laughter and puffs on Camel cigarettes, shows the storyteller's gift, and it's largely about storytelling of one kind or another. &quot;From my earliest moments, my dream was to write fiction,&quot; he said during an interview on his sunny Martha's Vineyard deck. &quot;I wrote a play when I was in the fourth grade and wrote short stories all the way through grade school, prep school, and most of the way through college.&quot;</p>


<p>
He grew up in Lake Forest, Ill., a son and grandson of successive publishers of the Waukegan News-Sun.   He went to the Cranbrook School in Michigan, a prep school for the sons of auto executives that has turned out many writers, then to Trinity College in Hartford. Despite four years of college, he never finished his degree.</p>


<p>
Married at 21, he worked as a reporter for his father for a year and a half, then in 1959 got a job with the Chicago bureau of Newsweek magazine, shifting to Washington in 1961, where he worked for then-bureau chief Benjamin Bradlee.  After leaving Newsweek for a short stint with the small news/commentary magazine The Reporter, he returned to Newsweek when Bradlee offered him the London bureau in 1963.</p>


<p>
Clearly, a great journalism career was underway. But Just itched to write fiction. In 1964, he took a six-month leave and went to Spain to write.    In retrospect, he disparages the results.</p>


<p>
&quot;Hemingway's ghost was hovering over me,&quot; he said. &quot;The stories were tremendously derivative, all about drinking and bullfighting. I sent them to Peter Davison, who at the time was reading fiction and poetry for both The Atlantic Monthly and Houghton Mifflin. He wrote me an encouraging letter and said he didn't think these things were quite right, but to keep at it. The problem was that I didn't know anything. I could put sentence after sentence together, but I didn't know what you have to know to write successful fiction.&quot;</p>


<p>
When Bradlee became managing editor of The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WPO">Washington Post</org> in 1965, Just went with him to work on the national staff.  Then Bradlee offered an assignment to Vietnam. &quot;It was as if some voice said to me, `This is something you'd better do,' &quot; Just said. He covered the war for 18 months. &quot;When I came back from Vietnam,&quot; he said, &quot;I knew what I didn't know. I was watching people, for the first time in my life, in extreme situations, the way people in that environment dealt with one another, while all the time there was this thundering war going on in the jungles.&quot;</p>


<p>
One thing he now knew was what it's like to be part of a small force surrounded by a hostile enemy, as he was during what he calls a senseless patrol by a unit of the US 101st Airborne in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1966. The mission was supposed to be a surprise, but the North Vietnamese found the Americans and attacked ferociously.  A dozen Americans out of about 40 were killed,  19 were wounded, and the survivors were saved by intense artillery support.  Just was sprayed by shrapnel from a hand grenade.  A framed photograph in his office shows him, his head heavily bandaged and shrapnel wounds all over his arm and shoulder.</p>


<p>
When he got home in 1967, he took accumulated leave, went to the village of Glin in Ireland, and wrote what would become a classic account of the war, &quot;To What End: Report From Vietnam.&quot;  &quot;It was a very strange experience, all this stuff coming up out of my memory,&quot; said Just. &quot;That convinced me I could actually write a book that hung together.&quot; Back in Washington, he was assigned to the 1968 presidential campaign, first following Eugene McCarthy, then Richard Nixon.</p>


<p>
&quot;It was a campaign of oceanic tedium,&quot; he recalled. &quot;Nixon would go from one place to the next and give the very same speech, and he had all these characters around him who thought I was a Red because I worked for the Post.&quot; He got off the campaign and worked for a while on the Post editorial board but says, &quot;I knew I was finished. I was a pretty good war correspondent, but I had absolutely no desire to go back to that war or any other war. With newspaper reporting, you've got to have a lust for news if you're going to do it well. I had lost it.&quot;</p>


<p>
In summer 1968,  he took another leave, went to New Hampshire, and wrote a novel in three months, &quot;A Soldier of the Revolution,&quot; set in an unnamed Latin American country.   It was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1970. &quot;It's not a perfect novel,&quot; he said, &quot;but it's not bad as novels go [it was recently republished by Public Affairs]. It didn't have much success, didn't get reviewed much. But I realized I could do it.&quot;  He quit the paper for good in 1969.</p>


<p>
His first marriage had ended when he returned from Vietnam. His second lasted 10 years, until 1978. In 1983 he married Sarah Catchpole, who is 17 years younger. From 1970 on, he wrote short stories, many of which appeared in the Atlantic, and novel after novel. In the 1980s, he inherited enough money to relieve some of the pressure to earn royalties and in 1982 bought the unassuming house on Martha's Vineyard.</p>


<p>
He and Catchpole moved to Paris in 1986, partly, she said, because &quot;people there didn't stare at us over the age difference, the way they did here.&quot; She learned a little French, he even less, but he found the community of expatriates and English-speaking intellectuals exhilarating. Eventually they missed the grit and tumble of American  life and returned to the Vineyard in 1992.</p>


<p>
Many reporters have become novelists, but few since Hemingway have moved so far from newspaper style as Ward Just. &quot;He has always been read as a very serious writer, especially in terms of style,&quot; said New York-based novelist Maureen Howard.   &quot;He is an  elegant writer.&quot;   Reporters writing fiction tend to place a high value on a dense texture of details. But Just said he had to learn to use fewer and more significant details.</p>


<p>
&quot;Factual material can overwhelm the vessel,&quot; he said.  &quot;I do think that what is going on behind the eyelids is more important than the eyelids. If you spend a lot of time on descriptive details, that detracts from what is going on inside a character, which you know by gesture and language.&quot;</p>


<p>
<span class="crosshead"/></p>


<p>
Just says none of his fiction is autobiographical, although, like Graham Greene and Joseph Conrad, he makes evident use of the varied settings he has known. He has lived or spent time in Chicago, London, Vietnam, Washington, Boston, Ireland, Vermont, Martha's Vineyard, Paris, Berlin. &quot;I tend to be an insomniac,&quot; Just said,  &quot;and one of the ways I get myself to sleep at night is to think about the places I have lived as an adult. I mean where you get your mail.&quot; He has had 28 addresses.  Newspapers figure in three of his novels.  &quot;A Soldier of the Revolution&quot; and &quot;A Dangerous Friend&quot;  concern guerrilla wars. &quot;The Weather in Berlin&quot; is about moviemaking;   &quot;The Translator&quot; is about gunrunning.  Three novels -- &quot;Jack Gance,&quot; &quot;In the City of Fear,&quot; and &quot;Echo House&quot; -- and several short stories focus on Washington politics and social life.</p>


<p>
&quot;He is one of the few really good novelists who have found a way to write about complicated political situations,&quot; said critic Sven Birkerts, editor of the Boston-based AGNI Magazine.  &quot;He has a natural cosmopolitan perspective. More than any American writer I can think of, he convincingly uses American, European, and Southeast Asian settings. He understands the dynamic of those places.&quot;</p>


<p>
&quot;Ward Just achieves the tones of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but he has a muscle that Fitzgerald didn't have,&quot; said Busch, who teaches at Colgate University.  &quot;What he writes about is what Shakespeare writes about in the history plays: dealing simultaneously with the emotions of individual men and women and with power at the local and the national level. `A Dangerous Friend' is a complete analysis of the origins of the Vietnam War, through the handling of six characters. That is a great achievement.&quot; (The book won the 2001 James Fenimore Cooper Prize for historical fiction from the Society of American Historians.)</p>


<p>
Just's stories are not about wars and politics, but about people and their tenacious illusions.   In &quot;An Unfinished Season,&quot; set mostly in the late 1950s in suburban Chicago, 19-year-old Wilson Ravan is the son of a factory owner.  He has a summer day job for a racy Chicago tabloid newspaper, while at night he attends debutante parties on the posh North Shore. He becomes involved with a brilliant girl whose gloomy father is a psychiatrist with a mysterious war record. Worked into this 251-page novel are a bitter labor strike; struggles over race, class,  and politics; and three separate love stories. In the epilogue, 40 years later on the island of Cyprus, Ravan is still trying to make sense of it all.</p>


<p>
Asked to name the recurrent theme of his work,  Just does not cite power, politics, or war.  To him, it's &quot;the inexplicable failure of nerve,&quot; which seems to mean the inability of a character at first to grasp what is actually happening -- like Ravan -- or to meet the challenge that follows finding out.  Just does not bludgeon the reader with a moral point.  The reader must pay attention to what the characters say, think, or suspect, and often they are less than clear, even to themselves.  These are books for grown-ups.</p>


<p>
&quot;I don't know where fiction is going today. It's all about dysfunctional families and being inert. It doesn't get you anywhere,&quot; said Peter Davison, who published several of Just's novels at Houghton Mifflin. &quot;But Ward's work involves maturity and maturation. Over and over in his books, people are being disabused of their illusions. They are sitting on a pier or a cafe in some remote place, realizing how big the world is.&quot;</p>


<p>
Just shows no signs of slowing down.  He already has a new novel underway, set in the Pyrenees.   Though he has many writer and artist friends on the island, he's part of no salon or coterie.  &quot;It's rare that I go out to lunch with anybody, or have anyone come in,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm pretty much here alone all day.&quot;  He usually puts in a full day of writing -- using a 40-year-old Smith-Corona manual typewriter.</p>


<p>
He is a bit wistful that his books have not sold better.  Partly, he thinks, it's because people think of him as a reporter, that they don't take him quite seriously as an artist, though &quot;I only did [journalism] in a serious way for about five years.&quot; Another factor, he suspects, is that the novel has lost its place at the center of the American intellectual experience.</p>


<p>
&quot;Imagine the difficulty,&quot; he said, &quot;of going to your editor and saying, `Here's a novel, it's so good, he's broken the mold, we should start the review on Page 1.' But Hemingway's `The Old Man and the Sea' was published in Life magazine, and the publisher added a half-million copies. Hemingway was on the bestseller list all the time. In his later years, so was Faulkner.   What book can you think of right now that is both a huge literary success and a huge commercial success?&quot;</p>


<p>
