<h1>Finding father</h1>
<h2>After years searching out his dad on the streets of Boston, Nick Flynn began to write it all down</h2>




<p class="byline"><span>By David Mehegan, Globe Staff &nbsp;|&nbsp;</span> <span
    class="date">October 20, 2004</span></p>

<div id="articleGraphs">
<div id="page1"><p>We went to look for Nick Flynn's father, as his son has done in his powerful and disturbing new book.</p><p>&quot;Another [expletive] Night in Suck City&quot; is a memoir of Nick Flynn's childhood and youth in Scituate, of six years working with the homeless at Boston's Pine Street Inn, of his mother's dissolution and suicide, and of his own struggle with alcohol, aimlessness, and loneliness. But most of all it's about coming to terms with his father's chaotic life, which included almost five homeless years on the streets of Boston (with a period of shelter at Pine Street while his son worked there), and which continues on its boozy way.</p><p>Jonathan Flynn, 74, lives in a subsidized apartment in the Fenway area. According to his son, he gets his disability check once a month, usually gets his rent paid, and drinks vodka until the money runs out. Mostly he eats in soup kitchens. The book -- recently excerpted in The New Yorker -- is Nick Flynn's account, but Jonathan Flynn haunts it and stars in it. His sour remark about a night of homelessness even gives the book its title.</p><p>We parked the car near his building, and Nick went in alone to see if his father was there. He wasn't. So Nick led a walking search of the neighborhood. When we reached a park near Westland Avenue, he pointed and said, &quot;There he is,&quot; and went ahead alone to<br/> speak to the thin man with long white hair, sitting alone on a bench, about 30 feet away, with a large paper cup between his knees. They shook hands like long-lost friends, and Nick looked toward me and beckoned.Jonathan Flynn's face and arms are deeply weathered, and his voice has a foghorn's resonance. Nick had given him a copy of the book, but he did not seem aware of its content. In the brief and rambling exchange that followed, he showed the effects of decades of heavy drinking.  &quot;How do you feel about being in this book?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Honored to be in it. Beyond words. Delighted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your son is a hell of a writer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He got that from his father. He's a handsome man because his mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw <i>in my life</i>. He's got a brain because I've got a brain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How do you feel about that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Proud. Why wouldn't I feel proud? I'm overjoyed. The depth . . . the truth comes out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The book is about getting on with life, and surviving. . . .&quot;</p><p>&quot;Precisely, that's what we're supposed to do. We have to know what life is all about. Up and down, in and out, what is good and what is bad. We have to know, to make proper decisions. . . .&quot;</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>&quot;Telling the story is important, too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Absolutely, truth is important. The word is <i>truth</i>.&quot;</p><p>Nick Flynn is 44 and unmarried, though he is in a relationship and hopes to have children someday. He lives in Athens, in upstate New York, and teaches writing one semester per year at the University of Houston. He has written three other books, including a collection of poems about his father, &quot;A Note Slipped Under the Door.&quot; He has also had a play produced in New York.</p><p>Flynn and his older brother grew up in Scituate, about 20 miles south of Boston, where Jonathan had married their mother after getting her pregnant. He was already into the pattern of drinking, drifting, and betrayal, and in 1960 his wife left him.  According to the book, he never paid any child support. He married and divorced again, did jail time for small offenses, and spent two years in federal prison for interstate traffic in stolen securities. He maintained his lifelong self-image as author of an imaginary novel, &quot;The Button Man,&quot; the few incoherent fragments of which his son eventually got a look at.</p><p>Nick Flynn's mother, meanwhile, went on to a succession of boyfriends, sinking gradually into drugs, until she turned a boyfriend's pistol on herself in 1982. Nick Flynn was attending UMass-Amherst at the time, but he dropped out and in 1984 took a job as a caseworker at the Pine Street Inn.</p><p>His mother's death, he explained while seated on a bench on Boston Common, &quot;is a big reason I ended up working at the homeless shelter. I was very lost at the time, and it was a place where it made sense to be lost, where I could submerge myself in a greater struggle so that my loss wasn't so prominent.  I could avoid the trap of self-pity. It's one of those adrenaline jobs where you're moving so fast that it's hard to stop and think; it allows you some buffer on the pain.&quot;</p><p>By then, Jonathan Flynn was back in Boston, living in a rooming house on Beacon Hill and writing strange, semi-coherent letters to his son. Nick went to visit him in 1987, the first time he had seen him in almost 20 years. A few months later, his father showed up at Pine Street, demanding a bed. He had been kicked out of his Beacon Hill place and for a while lived in his leased cab, until drinking cost him that job. Usually drunk, often abusive and hard to control, he was eventually barred from Pine Street.</p><p>For the next several years, when Nick and other Pine Street workers would drive a van on cold nights, looking for the homeless in alleys, park benches, or ATM lobbies, he would search for his father, too, and often find him. &quot;Each night,&quot; he writes, &quot;like another night in a long-running play, I wander the empty streets, check on every sprawled man until I find him, tension built into each blanket.&quot; Nick, meanwhile, fell deeper into drinking and getting high himself.</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>In 1990, Jonathan Flynn got the Section 8 apartment where he still lives. Soon after, Nick Flynn left Pine Street, moved to New York, quit drinking, finished college, and began teaching poetry to children in the New York City schools. He began to write poetry himself, and his first poems were all about his father. In 1995 he returned to Boston to try to understand him, and for two years he spent time with him, videotaping and listening to him. Much of the elder Flynn's voice in the book comes from those tapes, and from the hundreds of disjointed letters he wrote to his son.</p><p>Seven years ago Nick Flynn decided he had to go beyond poems, to confront his own and his family's demons in a nonfiction book. For one thing, when he would read his poems aloud, listeners would assume the father figure was metaphorical, not real.  The book he has written has three subjects: his life, his parents' lives, and the life of the people of the streets -- their names, days and nights, and in some cases their tragic fates.</p><p>&quot;After I transcribed his voice for a couple of years,&quot; Nick said, &quot;everything I wrote was trying to figure out who he was. There was a larger American story, a tragedy, the epidemic of homelessness, and the dislocation of fathers and sons. I wanted to humanize homelessness as best I could, and the closest I could get to it was through my father. When my father became homeless, I became homeless, too, in some ways. Psychically, there was a connection.&quot;</p><p>He left New York five years ago, he said, and while the book was unshaped and homeless, he could not find rest. &quot;I've been wandering around. I became dislocated in writing the book -- I realized that it was a necessary part of it.&quot; He moved to Europe and &quot;ended up writing a lot of it there. I finished it in Rome.&quot;</p><p>He returned from Europe a year ago. By then he had a contract with W.W. Norton on the basis of 40 early pages.</p><p>In his son's book, Jonathan Flynn's shattered life is laid bare without excuse or the smallest fig leaf. Though his son does not attack or even criticize him, the portrait he paints is full of failure, selfishness, self-delusion, and emptiness.</p><p>Asked whether he had ever hesitated about telling this story, felt misgivings over the decency of ripping away his living father's privacy and exposing his every sin and flaw, Nick Flynn gave an interesting answer:</p><p>&quot;I tell my students that if you feel that what you are doing is wrong or shameful, that you shouldn't be doing it, that's probably a good sign. I've never written anything where I felt completely confident that I was doing the right thing. For me, that is where the necessity comes from to write. No, it doesn't feel comfortable. Every step of the way, I had huge doubts. If I hadn't, I'm not sure I would have trusted it. I am dealing with someone else's life and potential shame. But that it was my father's, and became my shame when he came to the shelter, gave me, if not the license, at least the impetus to write it.&quot;</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>In his book and the interview, Nick Flynn shows no bitterness or self-pity, even when he reveals his father's worst moments and his own losses. During the encounter in the park, he treated his father with humor and gentleness, like a harmless old man he didn't know. He says he tries to keep it all in  perspective.</p><p>&quot;I don't think of it as an unhappy story,&quot; he said. &quot;It was just my life. I just got back from Africa [he's working on a book about the making of a documentary film in Tanzania], and it's kind of hard to have self-pity when you see the greater suffering in the world. Mine is minor by comparison, and so is my father's. He's living out his life in a certain way, and he and I have a relationship. I've had huge gifts in my life. The time I spent with my mother was a huge gift. Getting to know my father, working with the homeless, getting sober, were all huge gifts. I feel privileged.&quot;</p><p><span class="tagline"> David Mehegan can be reached at <a href="mailto:mehegan@globe.com">mehegan@globe.com</a>.</span></p><p><b>Why we act as we do</b></p><p>A couple months after he&#146;s evicted, a month before he arrives at the shelter, I see my father sleeping on a bench on the Esplanade.No more room, no more cab, all has led to this bench. . . .</p><p>Every week, it seems, scientists discover a new gene to explain why we act as we do, why we feel sad or why we get fat. Genes, it&#146;s now clear, are a mark on the blood, and the mark can be read and the life plotted. Easy as reading a map. This red mark is your father, across a vast sea from you. The scientists say that one day I could stand in the exact spot my father once stood in, hold my body as he did. I could open my mouth and his words would come out. They say it is only a &#145;&#145;tendency toward,&#146;&#146; a warning. They say it is not the future, but a possible</p><p>future.</p><p>I got high not long after seeing him on the Esplanade. I had a pipe I brought back from Morocco the year before, a long painted stem, a brass bowl. I told Richard I saw my father sleeping outside and Richard said, Your father&#146;s a mess.</p><p>NICK FLYNN, <i>from &#145;&#145;Another [expletive] Night in Suck City.&#146;&#146;</i></p><p><b>Nick Flynn will discuss his new memoir Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. at the Institute of Contemporary Art.</b><img
