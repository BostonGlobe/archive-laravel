The state funeral of Ronald Reagan, complete with caisson-borne casket and riderless horse, recalls  another such funeral more than 40  years ago: a much gloomier occasion, and a much younger president and widow. For those who remember John and Jacqueline Kennedy, that sense of youth is an immediate reaction to Sally Bedell Smith's new book, &quot;Grace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House.&quot; He was 43 when he took office in January 1961, and she was 31.</p>

<p>
In retrospect, they are fixed in a kind of historic amber. Jack Kennedy never grew old (he would be 87 today), and in a strange way, neither did the always-lovely Jackie, who died 10 years ago last month, at  64. Their moment passed when it was hardly begun, and the witnesses have spent the rest of their days trying to tell others what it was like.</p>


<p>
Smith, 55, has written several biographies -- her subjects have included  television tycoon William S. Paley and Princess Diana -- but this book was more<br/></p>


<p>
complicated. It's a narrative survey of characters and relationships. In a recent interview in the Oak Room of the Fairmont Copley Plaza, Smith explained the book as the story of a court and its courtiers. &quot;I didn't want to write the definitive political history of the Kennedy administration,&quot; Smith said. &quot;I thought, naively, that I would be writing about Jack and Jackie and a half-dozen people around them, but it turned out to be a larger group than I imagined. I set out to write the human side of history, to show how this network of relationships worked, how these private lives intersected with the big events of the time.&quot;</p>


<p>
It is a large group -- there are 42 names, with ages, listed in the dramatis personae at the front of the book -- which suggests the story is like a brief play on the world stage. It ends with the funeral of the<br/></p>


<p>
president and his family moving out of the White House, and the epilogue tells briefly what happened to the 41 afterward. The major players include the president's parents, brothers, and sisters; Theodore Sorensen, Kennedy's speechwriter and political alter ego; vice president Lyndon B. Johnson;  intellectuals  Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and John Kenneth Galbraith; defense secretary Robert S. McNamara; British ambassador, old family friend, and trusted adviser David Ormsby Gore; national security adviser McGeorge Bundy; and UN ambassador Adlai Stevenson.  They all had dealings with Jackie, too, in a personal way. Other players in her world are  her mother, Janet Auchincloss; Jackie's  sister, Lee Radziwill;  fashion designer Oleg Cassini ; and Letitia Baldrige,  the doyenne of style who advised Jackie on restoration of the White House.</p>


<p>
There's also an array of smaller parts, such as: Dave Powers,  a longtime political aide who helped  cover up for the president's indiscretions; Nancy Tuckerman, Jackie's oldest friend and social secretary; Mary Meyer,  a lover of the president and sister-in-law of Benjamin Bradlee, then Washington bureau chief for Newsweek magazine; Rachel &quot;Bunny&quot; Mellon, wife of financier and art collector Paul Mellon; Kirk &quot;Lem&quot; Billings, lifelong school friend of the president, who even kept a set of clothes at the White House; and columnist Charles Bartlett, who discarded journalistic detachment in his devotion to JFK.</p>


<p>
A Vanity Fair contributing editor since 1996, Sally Bedell Smith grew up near Philadelphia and graduated from Wheaton College in Norton in 1970 with a degree in history. She married journalist Stephen Smith within weeks of graduating and had no professional plan. But she took a job at the Carnegie Corp. in New York and soon worked her way up from the switchboard to  public relations.  Her boss spotted her writing gifts and urged her to develop them, so she took night courses at New York University and the New School (now New School University) and received  a master's degree in journalism from  Columbia University.</p>


<p>
While raising three children, she became a writer at Time magazine and later The New York Times, covering television, but she was drawn to writing full-length books about the people she found fascinating. &quot;The thrill is in the research and the reporting,&quot; she said, &quot;because I so much enjoy meeting these great characters.&quot; She is already at work on a book about the Clinton White House, scheduled for 2007.</p>


<p>
She began the Kennedy project in 2000, first by reading more than 100 books, and then conducting 142 interviews.</p>


<p>
For the major players, many of them authors themselves, Smith said, &quot;I took a lot of time reading their books and deconstructing them, because I knew that they had spent a lot of years talking about these things, and I wanted to pull new insights out of them, and that was a challenge.&quot;</p>


<p>
Her writer's eye pans back and forth like a weaver's shuttle, developing characters and creating depth and texture. Certain people -- Robert Kennedy and presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell,   to name two -- come across as hard-nosed and disagreeable. But most show an appealing humanness,  including such walk-ons as Helen Chavchavadze, a college classmate of Jackie's sister, Lee, and one of the president's lovers.</p>


<p>
Smith knew Chavchavadze had been part of the Kennedy social circle but did not know (until Chavchavadze unexpectedly revealed it in an interview) that she had had an affair with the president. Earlier, Chavchavadze had eventually became so stressed about the secret -- and a subsequent grilling she received from security agents while trying to get a job at the State Department -- that she experienced an emotional breakdown and checked into a psychiatric hospital. She tells of hearing about the assassination while standing at an ironing board. She was horrified, but she also tells Smith, &quot;When he was killed, a tiny part of me felt freed.&quot;</p>


<p>
It's no longer news, to be sure, but the extent of Kennedy's sexual adventuring is still startling. He clearly enjoyed risk-taking and what he called his &quot;DDS's -- &quot;deep dark secrets.&quot; Smith's index entry for &quot;Kennedy, John F., affairs,&quot; has 22 page references.</p>


<p>
His coterie, including pals in the press, shrugged or looked the other way. Journalist Fletcher Knebel said of the affairs, &quot;I just assumed he did his share of it.&quot; It's clear that Jackie knew the truth, if not all the whos and wheres, and that she loved him and found ways to compensate with willful  behavior, extravagant spending, fox-hunting, and event planning.</p>


<p>
&quot;There were unexpected poignant moments,&quot; Smith said of researching and writing the book, especially as she retold the shooting and its excruciating aftermath, in which Jackie was totally exposed yet totally self-possessed. Smith said, &quot;I got sort of choked up at times, particularly when I was reading the Manchester notebooks.&quot;</p>


<p>
Jacqueline Kennedy asked historian William Manchester (who died June 1 at 82),  to write an account of the assassination. His extraordinarily detailed manuscript so upset her and the family that he omitted portions from the 1967 book, &quot;The Death of a President.&quot;  But Smith went to Manchester while researching &quot;Grace and Power,&quot; and he agreed, for the first time, to give her access to his complete interview notes, hitherto sealed at the John F. Kennedy Library.</p>


<p>
&quot;There was an interview Manchester did with Bunny Mellon,&quot; Smith said. &quot;She recounted a conversation she had had with Jackie the night before the funeral, on the second floor of the White House, and Jackie, as she had been doing with various friends for the previous couple of days, described in graphic detail what had happened in the car, things like, `It wasn't disgusting, it was horrifying,' and, `All I wanted to do was protect him,' and she was sitting there with this Mass card with Kennedy's face on it. And she said to [Bishop Philip] Hannan, `I believe in God and I believe in heaven, but where has God gone?' &quot;</p>


<p>
Smith takes an evenhanded stance toward the cast and shows pity for the pathetic cases -- Billings, Meyer, and the tragic alcoholic   O'Donnell. She does not deplore anyone or anything, not even Kennedy's amours. Asked whether there were people she came to dislike, she paused for a second, then said, &quot;I can't think of anyone.&quot;</p>


<p>
In the end, Jack Kennedy remains something of an enigma on the personal level: rich in friends, but apparently not emotionally intimate with any of them, cool and somewhat superficial even with his closest associates. He's a man who makes use of other men, and many women, but so genially that those used seldom hold it against him. On the public stage, he is intensely engaged with politics and policy. He is cautious and skeptical, with endless sources of intelligence, a close reader of newspapers, a man willing to change his mind and  listen to good counsel.</p>


<p>
Although  her part is smaller, Jacqueline Kennedy is the unquestioned star of this play -- not only for her grace and style and beauty, but for her loyalty to friends, authentic feelings occasionally revealed, shrewd judgment of people, devotion to a man whose flaws she knows, and for the courage and sense of duty she showed throughout one of the worst ordeals of any woman's life.</p>


<p>
Some of her impulses and reactions  often reflect her elite, sheltered upbringing.  She compulsively spends fortunes on clothes and homes -- even the president gets angry and tries to cut her off. At one point, she expresses bafflement that some people think fox-hunting is &quot;a cruel sport of the idle rich,&quot; saying  it tends to &quot;bring out the best in people -- love of animals, each other, nature, sport, happiness, etc.&quot;</p>


<p>
But her image as a cosseted rich girl is displaced by her conduct during and after the assassination.  On that day, she refuses to take off the blood-soaked pink suit, though she had always before immediately changed clothes that showed the smallest spot. &quot;Let them see what they've done,&quot; she says. The pink suit is now in storage in the National Archives.</p>


<p>
Speaking of the Kennedy presidency, Smith said, &quot;There was almost a self-consciousness of its being a court.&quot;  In the public mind, that regal image was enhanced by the Camelot mythology that grew around it. &quot;There was no decline,&quot; Smith said. &quot;There was intellectual liveliness and nonstop social activities, the concerts and the performances, and the seminars. And then it was, as Bundy said, `like the fall of a curtain, or the snapping of taut strings.' &quot;</p>
