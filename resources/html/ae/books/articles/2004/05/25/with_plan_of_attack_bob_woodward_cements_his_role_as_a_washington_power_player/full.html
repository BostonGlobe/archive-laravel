<p>
&quot;You use the word `access.' I use the word `reporting,' &quot; he says. &quot;The ticket to them engaging you is to have information.&quot; Woodward got George W. Bush to sit down for more than three hours for his new book, &quot;Plan of Attack,&quot; after sending him a 21-page memo outlining what he'd learned in his reporting and showing the president that, in his words, &quot;I had the story.&quot;</p>

<p>
Three decades after getting the story that brought down President Nixon, Woodward, who is 61, still works at The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WPO">Washington Post</org>. But his real role -- reflected in &quot;Plan of Attack,&quot; an elaborate inside account of the administration's buildup to war in Iraq -- is to be the unofficial chronicler of official Washington, the man who explains the intricate machinations of the Beltway to the rest of the world. In doing so, he has become a power center unto himself, one of Washington's most famous residents and possibly the most influential journalist of his era.</p>

<p>
&quot;He's fundamentally a journalist,&quot; says William Powers, National Journal media columnist and a former research assistant for Woodward. &quot;But it's moved into a historian role.&quot; Weekly Standard senior editor Andrew Ferguson put it a little differently in a piece on Woodward's reporting: &quot;Bush is a self-confident man . . . but he's not self-confident enough to say no when Bob Woodward asks if he's got two hours to chat. . . . This is Woodward's town; the president just lives in it.&quot;</p>

<p>
In many ways, Woodward seems like a tangle of contradictions. He is a nonideological figure in the most partisan place in the country, a guy who keeps his opinions to himself in a city that demands and rewards polarizing punditry. He is a relentless investigative reporter who oozes benign Midwestern decency and decorum. And despite being privy to many of the ugly little secrets of how the US government functions, he remains a fervent believer in the health of our democracy.</p>

<p>
Woodward disdains ideologues, saying: &quot;I've seen too many true believers on both sides. It's fun to watch them, so many people who are so sure.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;It's a pretty good system,&quot; he insists. &quot;It elects people, and they have to show their stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>
With the bloodshed in Iraq dominating headlines and defining the 2004 election campaign, &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; generated a monstrous buzz when it was published last month. But the response was varied. Some saw it as a scathing indictment of a White House rushing into an ill-conceived war; others thought it depicted a strong and decisive commander in chief. White House spokesman Ken Lisaius says the book &quot;shows a president determined to deal with the threat posed to the United States by Saddam Hussein.&quot;</p>

<p>
It's no accident that the book's message is in the eye of the beholder. George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser who hosts ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; says people filter Woodward's work through the prism of their own politics. &quot;When you read his books, there's almost always a Rorschach test,&quot; he says. &quot;He's an equal-opportunity interrogator.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;You find people on both [political] extremes who have him caricatured,&quot; says Powers, adding that most people &quot;understand that he's not on anybody's team.&quot;</p>

<p>
Woodward isn't about to reveal much of his personal view of Bush, but he acknowledges the power of the president's physical presence. &quot;He thunders forth physically from the chair,&quot; Woodward says during an interview in his home in Georgetown. &quot;It's a physical engagement that does not come across on television.&quot; During one interview with Bush, Woodward recalls, the president &quot;bristled&quot; and got &quot;testy,&quot; and &quot;my mouth went dry at one point.&quot;</p>

<p>
He does not subscribe to the theory, publicized by former Bush treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and former counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke, that the White House seemed hellbent on overthrowing Hussein. &quot;I don't think they decided on Iraq,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it was incremental.&quot;</p>

<p>
His reluctance to inject more  analysis into his work is a source of frustration to some critics. But Woodward claims an allergy to drawing sweeping conclusions from the events of the day. &quot;I think there's a real danger in taking it further,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't know, and I've just been wrong on too many things analytically. . . . In 10 years, in Iraq, suppose it's a democracy, a stable country.&quot;</p>

<p>
Woodward proved the fallibility of his powers of analysis during a late 2002 appearance at a conference of military reporters, when he ventured that there was no more than a 50-50 chance that there would be war in Iraq.</p>

<p>
Woodward was born in Geneva, Ill., during World War II, the son of a judge. As a teenager, he says, he learned a valuable lesson in how the world worked by nosing through documents he found while working as a janitor in his father's office. There, he discovered that divorce and scandal simmered beneath the placid surface of Midwestern life.</p>

<p>
After graduating from Yale, he spent the tumultuous years of the late 1960s in the Navy, stationed on a communications ship, on a guided-missile frigate, and at the Pentagon. He was an inexperienced young reporter who had been at the Post for less than a year when he started working on a story about a burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building.</p>

<p>
Together he and fellow reporter Carl Bernstein -- abetted by a secret source called Deep Throat -- helped unravel the  Watergate scandal, which involved a pattern of political dirty tricks and a major coverup emanating from the White House. As a traumatized nation watched, Nixon was forced to resign in 1974 and the two journalistic heroes wrote a book called &quot;All the President's Men,&quot; which became a movie starring Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein and Robert Redford as Woodward.</p>

<p>
To this day, speculation abounds about the identity of Deep Throat, and Woodward has tossed out hints, saying the source is a man who is still alive. &quot;When he's dead he'll be identified and his story will be told,&quot; he says, adding mysteriously: &quot;It's a much more interesting story than I thought.&quot;</p>

<p>
The exploits of Woodward and Bernstein inspired a generation of young reporters and glamorized the journalism profession in the '70s; Woodward says that hundreds of journalists have told him he was a factor in their career choice. But the public is considerably more skeptical and jaded about the media business today. In the 1999 movie &quot;Dick,&quot; which spoofed Watergate, Woodward was played for laughs as a bumbler by comedian Will Ferrell. Woodward is not a fan of the film. &quot;I thought the first 10 minutes were quite funny,&quot; he says. &quot;But I think it went downhill.&quot;</p>

<p>
Today, Woodward is assistant managing editor at the Post. He is no longer an everyday newsroom presence, but he is still an integral part of the Post brand and on occasion fills in as the paper's top editor. When he's working on a book, he explains, the ground rules hold that if he uncovers something that needs to be published quickly, he contacts his sources and seeks permission to run the story in the paper. That did not happen with &quot;Plan of Attack.&quot;</p>

<p>
After combining more than 30 years in the newspaper business with another career cranking out bestsellers at a frantic pace, what drives a man nearing retirement age to stay at the top of the heap in a hypercompetitive media universe?</p>

<p>
&quot;Good old-fashioned American compulsion to excel,&quot; says former Post executive editor Ben Bradlee. &quot;He's the hardest-working guy I ever met.&quot;</p>

<p>
Woodward is not a gregarious, back-slapping type. But he has a Midwestern politeness and civility, and he is a careful listener -- disarming traits that are probably very helpful in eliciting information from sources.</p>

<p>
Woodward is &quot;deceptive-looking,&quot; says Bradlee, who describes him as a &quot;type A&quot; personality who is nevertheless &quot;not threatening. . . . He's got a kind of polite insistence. He's relentless. He'll come back at you 15 times. He wears people out.&quot;</p>

<p>
Woodward's reporting style requires lots of time and patience, as he starts on the perimeter and burrows his way into the heart of the story. &quot;It starts at the bottom of the information chain,&quot; Woodward says.  &quot;You start at the bottom with someone who's worked at one of these agencies who you've known for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;Everybody focuses on his access to the top level,&quot; says Stephanopoulos, who was a notable source himself for &quot;The Agenda,&quot; Woodward's book about the Clinton administration. &quot;What I don't think people get is that so much of his leverage comes because he has . . . unparalleled access to the lower levels of government.&quot;</p>

<p>
Woodward's relationships with sources and subjects have generated controversy over the years. A lengthy 1992 series on Dan Quayle that he coauthored for the Post generated so many complaints that it was too soft on the vice president that the paper's media critic, Howard Kurtz, wrote a story discussing that backlash. Woodward's 1987 book &quot;Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987&quot; raised eyebrows when Woodward relied on a hospital-bedside conversation during which, he said, a gravely ill CIA director, William Casey, nodded his head when asked if he knew about the diversion of funds from Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras.  Questions about the use of anonymous sources and the accuracy of Woodward's detailed recollections of events have arisen anew since the publication of &quot;Plan of Attack.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;People have called this `trust me' journalism,&quot; Woodward responds. &quot;There are an incredible number of documents and notes. . . . There's so much specific information in it with names and dates and places that if it's not correct, people will raise hell.&quot;</p>

<p>
These days, with Iraq commanding the nation's attention, two of the highest-profile journalists are tireless 60-somethings Woodward and Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker. Woodward says the two were competitive reporters and tennis partners during the Watergate era. &quot;He does not agree with everything I do,&quot; Woodward says. &quot;I don't agree with everything he does. But he's an important force in journalism and one of my heroes in a way.&quot; Stylistically and temperamentally, the two are very different kinds of investigative reporters: Hersh's persona as the outside agitator  contrasts sharply with Woodward's role as the Beltway insider.  At its core, Woodward's work is animated by an abiding respect for the town he lives in. &quot;He has this real corn-fed Midwestern view,&quot; says Powers. &quot;He really loves this system of ours . . . and he's really fascinated by people who get power in this system.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;I'm trying to find out as much as I can about what really happened,&quot; Woodward says. &quot;That's the first principle of our business, which I think we often forget. . . . How decisions are made, important decisions. That's the line that runs through everything.&quot;</p>

<p>
Asked if there are any big stories he regrets not breaking, Woodward says: &quot;I look at it as the event or institution that you wished you had described. I'd love to revisit the Supreme Court.
