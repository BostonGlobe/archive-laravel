<div id="articleGraphs">
<div id="page1"><p><b>THE STORY SO FAR</b>: <i>Tommy Cawler is a short, unusually small 13-year-old. So short, in fact, that he is often mistaken for a 9-year old. So short that he needs a footstool to reach the bathroom sink. He finds out he is going to spend his summer vacation on a remote island in Maine with a grandfather he has never met. Tommy takes the 12-hour bus ride alone from his home in Fox Crossing to his grandfather's place. Grampa, a man of few words, introduces him to Teeg, his Maine coon cat.</i></p><p>Tommy Cawler didn't fall asleep until dawn. The strange lights he'd seen from his window -- lights that looked like tiny red eyes -- haunted his dreams. He dreamt of small creatures with sharp teeth chasing him along a sandy beach. Somehow Teeg the cat was in the dreams, too, but much larger than normal, and his purr rumbled like thunder.</p><p>When Grampa finally came in to wake him, Teeg was still curled on the foot of bed, purring contentedly. It had been Teeg who had drawn him to the window late that night, as if the cat wanted him to see those mysterious lights. Now it slept soundly, like it didn't have a care in the world. Somehow it didn't seem fair.</p><p>''Didn't know what you liked for breakfast," Grampa announced. ''Will pancakes do?"</p><p>What a silly question! Tommy was out of bed in an instant, the bad dreams already half forgotten. The plates were set in the little breakfast nook, and the sweet perfume of pancakes and bacon filled the room. It wasn't until he was into his third helping that Tommy had time to wonder how Grampa had managed to make pancakes without electrical power. Didn't you need electricity for the stove?</p><p>But Grampa just smiled and shook his head. ''A little wood in the wood stove, that's all it takes," he said. ''Folks have lived in these parts for centuries and they always found a way to make pancakes, and most everything else, too."</p><p>After breakfast Grampa suggested that Tommy explore the island. ''It's important to know where you are in the world," he said. ''That way you can always find your way home."</p><p>Grampa led him out to the porch and showed him a ship's bell hanging from a beam. ''This will help. It's a ship's bell and I'll ring it for lunch and dinner. If you're lost in the fog, follow the sound of the bell. Got it?"</p><p>''Got it," said Tommy</p><p>''Let's get you exploring, shall we?"</p><p>Tommy followed Grampa down to the rocky shoreline. There was no sandy beach, just rocks and seaweed and cold, clear tidal pools between the rocks. The air smelled strongly of salt, and of damp carpets of glistening seaweed.</p>

</div>
<div id="page2"><p>''Look in the water," Grampa suggested. ''What do you see?"</p><p>At first Tommy saw only the distorted reflection of his own face and the clouds in the sky above his head. But then he noticed something moving slowly beneath the water and his eyes seemed to find their focus. ''A lobster!" he exclaimed.</p><p>Quickly he knelt down and poked his finger into the cold water. The lobster scuttled back, wedging itself under a rock.</p><p>''Best be careful," Grampa cautioned. ''Even a small lobster like that has mighty strong claws."</p><p>Tommy immediately snatched his hand out of the water, but he wasn't really afraid -- the lobster moved pretty slowly. Just to be careful, he found a small stick and used it to poke among the rocks, disturbing crabs and snails and a few small, silvery fish. The lobster remained hidden, the silent queen of her tidal world.</p><p>''There are pools like this all around the island," Grampa said. ''When you get back to where you've started, then you'll have explored the whole place. I'll be in my shop if you need me."</p><p>When he looked up again Grampa was gone. Tommy was pleased. Obviously his grandfather thought he was old enough to take care of himself. For the rest of the morning he happily moved from tidal pool to tidal pool, scampering across the rocks and wading up to his ankles.</p><p>He discovered dozens of small, undersea creatures. Several kinds of crabs. Starfish that came in various shapes. Snails of all sizes. Hard-shelled animals that looked like pin cushions. Soft, delicate things that reminded him of glass vases. Purple mussels clustered to the rocks. Clams shaped like butter knives. Little bugs that jittered across the surface of the water like excited figure skaters.</p><p>It was amazing how many things lived in the tidal pools. Probably it would take the rest of the summer for him to discover them all.</p><p>Tommy was about halfway around the island -- he could just see a curl of smoke coming from the chimney -- when Teeg decided to join him.</p><p>''Wow!" the cat seemed to say, landing with a pounce at his feet.</p><p>''I know you didn't really say 'Wow!,' " Tommy said to the purring cat. ''It's just the way you say 'meow,' right?"</p><p>The big, green-eyed cat seemed to wink at him. Probably it was just blinking, or had a drop of salt water in its left eye. Cats did not wink. Tommy knew that for sure. But then again he'd never known a cat quite like Teeg.</p><p>As they came around the corner of the little island and saw Grampa's house in the distance, Tommy wondered again about what he'd seen the night before. The hundreds of tiny red lights on the mysterious island, lights that looked very much like strange little eyes.</p>

</div>
<div id="page3"><p>In the full light of day the neighboring island didn't look at all mysterious. It was simply a large, hump-back island with clusters of low trees, and dense undergrowth near the waterline. In size it was much bigger than Grampa's little island, but Tommy couldn't see any buildings on the big island, or any sign of a dock.</p><p>''What lives there, Teeg, do you know?"</p><p>By way of answering the cat rubbed Tommy's ankles and made noises that sounded like ''Ow! Ow! Ow!"</p><p>The door to Grampa's shop was open when they got there. It was little more than a shed with a slanting roof, attached to the main building, but Tommy was amazed by what he saw.</p><p>Grampa was building a boat.</p><p>Not a full-sized boat -- there wouldn't have been room for that -- but a beautiful wooden model of a traditional sailing dory. It was about two feet long, equipped with scale-model oars and a perfect little mast. Grampa was lacing the tiny sail to the mast when Tommy and Teeg entered the shed.</p><p>''Wow," said Tommy, marveling over the little boat. ''That is so cool!"</p><p>In the front of the boat -- Grampa called it ''the bow" -- there was even a little anchor and a coil of small anchor line. In the back of the boat -- Grampa called it ''the stern" -- was a miniature bait barrel. Neatly folded under the seats was a small fishing net, complete with miniature cork floats.</p><p>''Where did you find a net so small?" Tommy wanted to know.</p><p>''Made it myself," Grampa said, ''with my handy knitting needles."</p><p>''You can knit?" Tommy asked, amazed.</p><p>''All sailors can knit," said Grampa. ''We don't knit sweaters out of yarn, we knit fishing nets out of line. A good sailor can sew, too. He has to, so he can repair a sail or patch his pants when he's a hundred miles from shore."</p><p>When Tommy got up close to the little boat, he saw that the details were amazing. Each plank was fastened with tiny copper rivets, and the rudder was attached to the back (the transom, Grampa called it) with miniature bronze hinges that were called ''pintles and gudgeons."</p><p>''Every part of a boat has a special name," he explained, pointing out the various pieces of wood that held the boat together. ''Don't worry if you can't remember them all," he said. ''You'll learn them, just like you learned your ABC's. You'll soak it up from the salt air."</p><p>Tommy couldn't get over how beautiful the little boat was, and how everything about it was perfect and exactly right. ''What will you do with it, Grampa?" he asked. ''Who is it for?"</p>

</div>
<div id="page4"><p>Grampa looked at him sideways. ''Does a boat have to be for someone in particular?"</p><p>''I don't know," Tommy admitted.</p><p>''Can't say who will get this boat, exactly," Grampa said, covering it up with a dust cloth. ''Whoever it fits."</p><p>Whoever it fits? What did he mean by that? Did he mean a small boy who had discovered how much he loved the idea of a model boat? A small boy who imagined letting it set sail in one of the tidal pools?</p><p>By the time he went to bed that night, Tommy had convinced himself that the model boat was going to be a birthday gift from Grampa. He could imagine it placed on top of his dresser at home. His friends would be amazed. Maybe he'd take it out to a local pond and show them how well it sailed. Or maybe not. Maybe he wouldn't want to risk getting it wet. Maybe he'd keep it in special glass case and only allow important people to look at it. People who understood about copper rivets and the pintles and gudgeons and bows and sterns, and how true sailors knitted up their fishing nets.</p><p>It was very pleasant, thinking about the little boat, and he was almost drifting off to sleep when Teeg pounced on his chest. This time Tommy sat up immediately. He knew better than to ignore the cat. If Teeg wanted him to wake up, then he would wake up.</p><p>''What is it?" he asked the cat. ''What's wrong?"</p><p>Once again Teeg led him to the little windows that overlooked the backyard. But this time there were no tiny red eyes looking at him from the mysterious island. This time the cat wanted him to see something much closer to home.</p><p>Grampa in the moonlight, trudging silently out to the shore. Grampa with the model dory in his arms. Grampa putting the little boat in the water, raising up the little sail, and letting it go.</p><p>Grampa looked up at Tommy's window and then turned his back, walking away from the shore as the little boat sailed off into the distance.</p><p>''No!" cried Tommy. ''No!"</p><p><h3>Pat Four: Tiny little teeth</h3>Tommy raced down the stairs in his pajamas. All he could think about was saving the little boat. Was Grampa crazy? Why would he do such a thing? Why would he work on the perfect little model for months and then let the sea take it away?</p><p>The screen door slammed behind him. He could feel the damp grass under his bare feet as he ran. Running through long dark shadows cast by the pale light of the moon. Running for the water's edge, where he could just see the little patch of white sail as the boat got further and further from shore.</p>

</div>
<div id="page5"><p>''Grampa!" he cried. ''Grampa, the boat!"</p><p>But his grandfather was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Without thinking about the consequences, Tommy splashed into the shallow water. He ran until the cold water was up to his chest, until he couldn't run anymore.</p><p>Go for it, he decided. Swim for the boat. If you don't try and get it right now, it will be gone forever.</p><p>Tommy was a good swimmer, having had lessons for the last three summers. He wasn't afraid of going in over his head because he knew how to stay afloat. Besides, the little boat looked like it was within reach, if he swam vigorously for a few minutes.</p><p>At first he dog-paddled, mostly because that felt the safest, but the boat kept getting further away, so he switched over to a crawl. Lifting his arms out of the water and bringing them down with all his might. By accident he splashed salt water into his eyes and for a moment he couldn't see anything.</p><p>It was very scary, being out in the ocean over his head at night, and not knowing exactly where he was, or what direction would take him home. But Tommy remembered what his swimming instructor said, and he didn't panic. He took deep breaths and waited for his eyes to clear and after a few scary moments he was able to make out the white sail.</p><p>The wind had gotten stronger and the little boat was being blown toward the mysterious island. Tommy thought about turning around, and then realized he was about halfway between the two islands. Might as well keep going. The wind and the current seemed to be carrying him toward the island anyhow, so why fight it?</p><p>Tommy redoubled his efforts. Soon he was in rhythm, kicking in sync with his arm motions, cupping the water with his hands. He was within a few hundred feet of the island when all of a sudden the current changed and he felt himself being swept sideways.</p><p>It was as if the tide and current wanted him to miss the island and be taken out to sea. He decided he might get there faster if he back-stroked, relying on his legs, and he rolled over and started kicking as hard as he could. Kicking for his life.</p><p>That's when he saw Teeg the cat. At first he wasn't sure what he was looking at. Then he realized it was Teeg with just his head above the water, soaking wet and trying to keep up with him.</p><p>''Teeg!" he shouted. ''Go back!"</p><p>Shouting was a mistake. He swallowed a big mouthful of cold water and the next thing he knew he was coughing so hard he couldn't breath.</p><p>Tommy started to sink. This is what it's like to drown, he thought.</p><p>And then he felt his feet connect with something hard. Gravel and stones under him. He was only a few yards from shore, almost there. He was still coughing and getting weaker by the moment, but he managed to aim himself in the right direction.</p><p>Tommy was only half conscious when the tide nudged him up onto the gravel shore of the island. He had no idea what had happened to poor Teeg and he was so weak he couldn't open his eyes and look.</p><p>I'll just sleep for a minute, he thought. Then I'll get up and look for Teeg, the brave cat who had followed him into the water.</p><p>In his dream he heard a pitter-pat sound. Was it the cat? Was Teeg OK? Tommy struggled to open his eyes, but he was facedown in the gravel, soaking wet, too cold and weak to move.</p><p><em>Pitter-pat</em>. There it was again. Tommy forced his eyes open.</p><p>''Ahh!" he screamed.</p><p>Dozens of tiny red eyes were looking at him. Tiny eyes only a few inches from his face. Eyes that belonged to many small creatures. Creatures so close and so quick he couldn't see what they looked like.</p><p>Creatures that swarmed all over him.</p><p><em>Get up</em>, he told himself, <em>you must find Teeg!</em></p><p>But before he could move, something fierce began to bite his legs and ankles. Something with tiny little teeth that pierced like needles. Something that sent him deep into the darkness, into some place that was much, much deeper than sleep.</p><p><span class="tagline">Rodman Philbrick's ''The Tinycawlers," a story for young readers, is being published in The Boston Globe on eight Tuesdays beginning April 4 and ending May 30.
