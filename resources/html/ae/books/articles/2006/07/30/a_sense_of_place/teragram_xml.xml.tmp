		<myarticlebody>&lt;p&gt;What better training for a photographer than to observe the simple life of the Shakers ?  Stephen Guion Williams  met the Shakers at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, as a teenager in the early 1970s before he picked up a camera. He kept returning. Now he has published ``A Place in Time " (Godine),  his second book of photographs about that  settlement. Its four members  compose  the last active Shaker community in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the pages of black-and-white photographs, the Shakers pray, construct  boxes, and bring in the harvest.   The bread rises; the sun sets. Williams will talk about the book and exhibit photographs at 1:30 p.m.  Aug. 12  at Sabbathday Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="crosshead"&gt;Worthy of Wheatley &lt;/div&gt; Victoria Christopher Murray, the author of six Christian novels, has won the 2006 Phillis Wheatley  Award for excellence in contemporary fiction. Her latest novel is ``A Sin and a Shame." The award, presented at the eighth  annual Harlem Book Fair  this month,  honors the memory of poet Phillis Wheatley,  a slave in Boston who rose to become something of a literary celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also honored at the fair were Walter Dean Myers, author of ``Malcolm X: By Any Means Necessary,"   and Omar Tyree,  author of 13 books about urban hip-hop culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="crosshead"&gt;All in the family &lt;/div&gt;At least Owen King has a sense of humor about living in the shadow of his father, that scary writer from Maine. ``It's going to be the first sentence in my obituary," he says. ``I have to live with that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the younger King is working on his first novel, a  comedic story. He admires Jakob Dylan,  son of Bob,  for forging an identity separate from his famous dad. ``I wish I was as good - looking as he is," he quips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, who lives in Brooklyn, will appear at Brookline Booksmith, 279 Harvard St., at 7 p.m. Thursday  to read from ``We're All in This Together," a  novella and stories recently published in paperback. In the novella, an activist liberal family struggles to make sense of the 2000 presidential election. Appearing with King will be Adam Davies, another writer with a fondness for dark humor and eccentric families. Davies' s new book is ``Goodbye Lemon," the follow-up to his debut novel, ``The Frog King."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="crosshead"&gt;Coming out &lt;/div&gt;``Fighting for Dear Life: The Untold Story of Terri Schiavo and What It Means for All of Us," &lt;em&gt;by David Gibbs with &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bob DeMoss&lt;/em&gt; (Bethany House)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``Judge and  Jury," &lt;em&gt;by James Patterson and &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Andrew Gross &lt;/em&gt;(Little, Brown)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``The Heart  and Soul of Sex," &lt;em&gt;by Gina Ogden &lt;/em&gt; (Trumpeter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="crosshead"&gt;Pick of the week &lt;/div&gt;Anne Wagner of Porter Square Books, in Cambridge, recommends ``Errors and Omissions," by Paul Goldstein (Doubleday),  as ``a tight, entertaining legal thriller worthy of Grisham." Attorney Michael Seeley ,  in Los Angeles for routine legal work for a motion picture studio, ``unearths a hornet's nest of betrayal, corruption, and murder." Book Sense, a national marketing campaign for independent bookstores, is promoting the book during July.&lt;/p&gt;
