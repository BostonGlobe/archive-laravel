		<myarticlebody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breach of Faith: Hurricane Katrina and the Near Death of a Great American City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;By Jed Horne&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Random House, &lt;/em&gt;412 pp., &lt;b&gt;$25.95&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by Times-Picayune metro editor Jed Horne, with input from members of his Pulitzer Prize-winning staff, ``Breach of Faith" may not be the definitive account of Katrina's impact on New Orleans and the Gulf  Coast -- it is  too early for that -- but it   sets the benchmark for  future books on the subject. The breathtaking sweep of the reporting, the epic drama of the narrative, the thousand acts of heroism, courage, folly , and crime that it chronicles  provide a vivid mosaic of one of the worst natural disasters ever to strike  a US city -- a disaster that human negligence and incompetence turned into a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who watched the TV reports and read the newspaper accounts is familiar with the scenes of desperate people stranded on the rooftops, of bodies floating  in  the toxic swill, of the hellish conditions in the Superdome and convention center where hordes of mostly poor black people waited for the supplies and buses that, it seemed, would never arrive. Horne transports the reader directly into those scenes  to share the anger and desperation of the  victims, as well as the thoughts and hopes of the vastly outnumbered medical and relief workers who struggled to save and comfort them. He also puts the reader in the conference rooms   and chic restaurants where the movers and shakers -- including many of those whose blunders had compounded the disaster -- plotted the city's future. Horne's ability to flesh out the human dimension of the drama is his very real strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's heroes run the gamut from swamp boat volunteers and ad hoc neighborhood organizers to stressed-out doctors at Charity Hospital and whistle-blowing scientists. Horne pays particular attention to the relentless efforts of Ivor van Heerden,  deputy directory of the Hurricane Center at Louisiana State University,  to prove that the main levee failure was the result of fundamental design defects and not, as the  US   Army  Corps of  Engineers claimed, of ``overtopping" due to a storm of unprecedented strength. (Katrina  had weakened from Category 5 to Category 3 by the time it made landfall.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of villains starts in the Oval Office. President Bush  comes in for a big share of the blame. ``Katrina was a test of Bush's faith in smaller government and his fixation on  foreign  terror," writes Horne, ``and rarely does history grade a presidency so quickly or so harshly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing illustrated the Bush administration's failure better than the baffling inefficiency of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Michael Brown was so  incompetent as the head of FEMA that the president sacked him   10 days after pronouncing those now famous words: ``Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But FEMA's problems were  systemic. The agency issued a steady stream of boneheaded decisions and non decisions. It nixed a request for rubber rescue boats, for example, because there might be ``debris"  in the floodwaters. At the airport, a volunteer doctor from Pennsylvania was ordered to stop giving a chest massage to a dying woman because he wasn't registered with FEMA. Three months after the storm, FEMA parked 31,000 trailers in Arkansas and Mississippi but had no place  in the stricken areas to put many of them -- and one-third of them were of a type that FEMA  deemed unsafe for use in floodplains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of villains hardly stopped in Washington. Horne argues that the  failure of the levees was the product of decades of underfunding, design errors , and shoddy work by the  Army  Corps of  Engineers -- compounded by the incompetence of the corrupt, patronage-ridden  levee board that was charged with maintaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not  the  least of the villains were the lawless bands of looters who took advantage of the post-storm power vacuum . What   could not be excused  was the mass desertions of New Orleans police officers and the participation of many of them in  looting binges .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the regional politicians, Louisiana Governor Kathleen  Blanco comes off better in Horne's view than New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin.  Though both were early victims of the Bush  administration's ``blame game,"  Blanco ultimately demonstrated a steely core and deft political skills . Nagin, for all his affability, dithered inexcusably before ordering a mandatory evacuation, failed to pre pare for transport and relief services, appointed a local recovery committee  and  then ignored its central recommendation to convert flood-prone areas into parkland. All of which, in Horne's view, smacked of political pandering to the local electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horne makes a persuasive case for his claim that human error and incompetence vastly compounded Katrina's catastrophic effects. There is no ``single-bullet"  explanation, as he notes in the conclusion, but he offers a long catalog  of contributing factors. Among them: political partisanship, the excessive focus on the war on terror, the Bush bias against big government, the Iraq  War and its resulting deficits, even, Horne suggests, a ``lethargic federal response" to the needs of ``a majority black -city."  Not  the  least of the causes he cites was the lack of ``anything remotely like leadership emerging from among the gaggle of politicians at city hall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, as that magical, mythical city struggles to rebuild, Horne's book offers little real hope that the lessons of Katrina will protect New Orleans from the next ``big one" -- or from the failings of those who, from Washington to the  mayor's office, breached its faith and left it vulnerable to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="tagline"&gt;Tom Sancton, a New Orleans-born journalist and jazz musician, is the author of ``Song for My Fathers: A New Orleans Story in Black and White."   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</myarticlebody>
