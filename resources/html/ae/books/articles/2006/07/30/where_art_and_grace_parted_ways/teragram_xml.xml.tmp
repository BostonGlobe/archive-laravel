		<myarticlebody>&lt;p&gt;I have just read two books, back to back, both with balked artistic careers at their heart , and it has been an unsettling experience. Separated by 50 years, a millennial divide, and a thoroughgoing transformation of Western consciousness, they could have been written by members of two different species. One is the novel  &lt;strong&gt;``Every Eye,"&lt;/strong&gt; by Isobel English, first published in England in 1956 (and just    republished by David R. Godine , $23.95), and the other is a memoir, &lt;strong&gt;``&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,"&lt;/strong&gt; by David Goodwillie, published last month  in this country (Algonquin, $2 3.95).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English's novel is about Hatty (is there a Hatty still treading the earth?), the only child of a widow, who is supported to an extent by the brother of her dead husband. Though Hatty is a gifted   pianist, she is made to understand, after a ``little talk" with her uncle, that her straitened circumstances make a musical career impractical. She will have to support herself in the future in some drably respectable way, for it is assumed she will never marry thanks to a disqualifying blemish, a lazy eye. The oppressiveness of this practicality, the patronizing disregard for her ambition, and the conferral of dowdy spinsterhood upon her by the adults around her are conveyed brilliantly as Hatty recalls meeting her uncle's wife-to-be, Cynthia, for the first time. `` `Your Uncle Otway tells me that you play the piano very well,' she had said, and at the back of her smile and simple words I could hear the deep billowing voice of Uncle, explaining away my small successes in the Royal Academy exams; my aspiration; my father's death; my mother's struggle for our survival; and how good it would be if I could be `persuaded, not forced, mind you, because I believe in people having a will of their own,' into going to one of those secretarial colleges that overlooked the saddest part of the Park."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that Hatty  does eventually attend the Royal Academy, but it is as if her spirit has been hobbled by the assumptions of her family. When she has an affair with a much older man, a friend of her uncle's and Cynthia's, the two, especially Cynthia, interfere in a subtle but unmistakable way. Hatty ends up earning a meager living giving piano lessons to talentless children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be all too depressing were it not for the fact that this life of limitation is being recollected by Hatty many years later, juxtaposed with a present in which she is married to -- can this be our dun-colored Hatty? -- a younger man. And that is not the only critical contrast. While Hatty becomes disentangled from her dreary predicament, from ``the cloudy grasp of interfering relations," we find Cynthia increasingly encumbered and stifled by the demands of keeping up a semblance of a genteel existence for her now-retired, improvident, not especially honorable husband. The final revelation of a secret, invisible to some, that has charged  the relations between the main characters sheds further light upon the motives, acknowledged or otherwise, propelling the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatty's and Cynthia's worlds trade places, thwartedness and limitation give way to fulfillment in Hatty's case, the reverse in Cynthia's. But why is Hatty so blessed? This is a time and place, after all, that does not endorse ``choice." It is music, her art, which saves her -- as we discover. In the world conjured by English, from an understanding that was not peculiar 50 years ago, it is clear that art is equated with grace. It is a private grace granted from what I am afraid we shall have to guess to be God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in general, art and grace haven't much to do with each other. &lt;org idsrc="other-OTC" value="FLWR"&gt;Celebrity&lt;/org&gt; and art, sincerity and art, worthiness and art, social change, values, empowerment, transgression and art: that all works. Don't argue with me: I just saw it this way while I was reading David Goodwillie's very funny memoir (or so-called memoir, as I can't believe that every incident in it is true or that the pages and pages of dialogue would stand up in court).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young man, Goodwillie had the idea that he'd like to be ``some kind of a writer," but his first career move after college was to become a professional baseball player. As he describes it, in entertainingly self-deprecating luridness, that didn't work out. So it's back to thinking about becoming a writer again -- until he's handed a job in a top private security agency. That, too, is not a good fit. The next stop is, in fact, a writing job -- of sorts. It is providing descriptions of sports memorabilia for auction catalogs. He finds he has to pare down his heartfelt style and generate copy, but in his spare time he begins to work on his own stuff. He gets going on ``a morality tale about an artist who doesn't compromise, who creates for the challenge of the  act itself, not the economic afterlife."  Fortunately that didn't pan out. Then there is ``the heroic tale of a stripper who goes to NYU and the young writer who falls in love with her."  We have been spared that too, thank God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while he was nursing a current of anguish about what he should be writing, he was busy living and working in the New York of some of its most bizarre days: the  most recent turn of the century. Everyone (who matters) has choices and can be what we may term themselves. But what do they want -- aside from money? Authenticity: not their own, of course, but marketed authenticity in the shape of such modern versions of the true cross as ``the very first baseball," Babe Ruth's ``last bat," and the jersey Gary Cooper wore in `` The  Pride of the Yankees" (Billy Crystal paid $239,000 for that). Goodwillie is wonderful in describing not only this sad and lucrative trade, but the next step along the road to pure abstraction: dot-commery. The mission of the start-up he ends up with is   to `` leverage the Web's worldwide reach to revolutionize the dynamics of charitable giving by offering one-of-a-kind celebrity collectibles and experiences."   In all this he has his great subject for these latter days.&lt;/p&gt;
