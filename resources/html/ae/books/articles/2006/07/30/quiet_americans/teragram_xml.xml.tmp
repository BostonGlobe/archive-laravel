		<myarticlebody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief Encounters With Che Guevara: Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;By Ben Fountain&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecco,&lt;/em&gt; 229 pp., &lt;b&gt;$24.95&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vogue for short story collections has been over for a long time  in American publishing. Writers find it harder to publish short fiction, and booksellers find it hard to sell. People generally don't want to buy such books, it seems, but people ought to buy this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories in Ben Fountain's first collection, ``Brief Encounters With Che Guevara," are mostly set  on a sort of floating island, inhabited by nongovernmental organization workers and international observers and strays from commerce and the military, that drifts around a lot of Third World countries. Fountain isn't the first writer on this ground -- novelist Robert Stone  has found gold here -- but the field has seldom been mined for short fiction. These stories don't otherwise remind you of Henry James, but they do show Americans out of their element and a long way from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountain knows his turf very well, in South America and West Africa and Haiti; he understands Haitian culture from the inside out. Ironic situations abound:  In ``Near - Extinct Birds of the Central Cordillera,"  an ornithological graduate student is held prisoner by leftist Colombian guerrillas.  It's a terrific opportunity for fieldwork, but in the end he learns the birds' habitat will be destroyed by the guerrillas' sale of the forest to a  US timber concern. ``The Good Ones Are Already Taken"  gives us a young  army wife trying to grapple with the bewildering fact that her husband, in the course of a  special  forces mission, has made a mystical marriage with a voluptuous Haitian goddess. In ``Bouki and the Cocaine,"  a group of peasants capitalize on the farcical play-acting of the Haitian day of the dead to outwit gangsters, politicians, and the police. Many of these stories are not only ironic but downright funny -- at the same time that they feel solid and real and invested with a genuine pathos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them are fully realized works of fiction, except for the title piece, which looks like an autobiographical essay in very thin disguise. As a child the narrator meets one of  Guevara's lovers, now a faculty wife at a small Virginia college. As a young man he moves furniture alongside a member of the unit that killed  Guevara. As he grows older the ``encounters" become more ethereal and abstract.  On its own this story would be no more than a string of mildly interesting coincidences,  but it serves very well to establish the overall feeling of this book, since so many people see the ghost of Third World political idealism hovering over the bones of the martyred  Guevara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ghost is walking in ``The Lion's Mouth,"  a story set in the midst of Sierra Leone's civil war. Jill, a child of  stateside wealth and privilege, is a veteran of the Peace Corps and various NGOs, now working in food relief. Her pet project is a sewing cooperative where women victims of Sierra Leone's campaign of terroristic mutilation devise ways to combine the arms they have left to do needlework. Romantically she's suspended between Dennis, an idealistic fellow traveler who helps with the co-op, and Starkey, a relatively ruthless diamond dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sewing circle is out of money, and a sudden embargo on diamonds offers Jill a solution:  She'll smuggle diamonds for Starkey in a food-aid convoy, and put her cut of the money  into the co-op. Though it's a dangerous game, a win should be worth it, yet Jill is burning out her own set of values: ``She'd chosen this life because she couldn't imagine any other way, but over time, without her being strictly aware of it, the dead stares of the thousands of amputees had served to drain all the purpose out of her work. Those stares, the aura of hopelessness that always settled over the camps, implied that they knew something Jill didn't, a basic fact that had taken her years to understand."   Lately she prefers Starkey to Dennis because Starkey ``began to seem pure to her . . . he seemed to operate  with a firm understanding of what was and was not possible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this and most of the other stories, Fountain handles the action with the smooth virtuosity of Stone or Graham Greene or John  le Carr&amp;#xE9;.  During her return, Jill's convoy is diverted to rescue some nuns from a mission about to be overrun by a rebel army. To her horror she learns that the plan is to save the foreigners only, and leave a large number of Africans to certain mutilation, and probable death. So Jill buys their way out by giving up the diamonds to the rebel leader, and marches with the victims she's ransomed,   14 kilometers to the next town. To save these lives she's sacrificed everything: the diamonds, the sewing co-op, her relationship with Starkey. A few minutes after she collapses at the end of the march, one of the soldiers of her escort makes a devastating statement. ``Please, Miss. We need to know what to do with these people now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indictment of missionary tourism is the bitterest point this book has to make: Jill's sense that ``she couldn't save anyone but herself."  But somehow it must make a difference to try. For  25 years, American short stories have turned relentless ly  inward; it's refreshing how  Fountain's stories reach for a broader engagement. Well before the turn of the   21st century there was a growing need for Americans to understand and imagine more than they do about the rest of the world. This book is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
