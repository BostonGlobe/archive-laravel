		<myarticlebody>&lt;p&gt;Very few truly delightful Christmas books appear in a season, despite the landslide of brave attempts, so when one sparkles along, it&amp;#8217;s a reason for holiday celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Scotton, best-selling author of &amp;#8220;Splat the Cat&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; and its sequel, &amp;#8220;Love, Splat,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; comes through brilliantly in &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; &lt;/strong&gt;Everything about this picture book is joyfully simple, from the red, green, and white front cover, to the back cover with nothing but a red Christmas ornament dangling off Splat&amp;#8217;s impossibly curled tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story line is also simple: It&amp;#8217;s the day before Christmas, and Splat is composing a letter to Santa explaining what a &amp;#8220;really big present&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; he wants for Christmas and what a &amp;#8220;very good cat&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; he&amp;#8217;s been all year. His best friend, Seymour the mouse, is suitably impressed, but Splat&amp;#8217;s little sister looks askance at him and gives &amp;#8220;Splat a look that only little sisters can give. &amp;#8216;R-e-a-l-l-y?&amp;#8217; &amp;#8217;&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That plants the seed of doubt that sends Splat into a frenzy of last minute helpful behavior that nearly drives his mother crazy and guarantees Splat one very sleepless night  - while comically Santa sneaks up on him each time he turns over in bed. Scotton&amp;#8217;s humor is deft and gentle  - he never says or shows too much: the teetering tower of Christmas china Splat washes; the way he weirdly redecorates the Christmas tree; that cynical look on his little sister&amp;#8217;s face. Scotton&amp;#8217;s cats are all wonderfully bulgy-eyed, and he can wrestle more expression from an eyeball than other artists can from a whole canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; will appeal to those who have been very good, those who haven&amp;#8217;t, and anyone who loves the thrill of a good yarn spinning out with perfect color, tone, and timing. I&amp;#8217;d put &amp;#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; right up against a handful of Christmas children&amp;#8217;s favorites, where I am willing to bet it will hold its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Christmas with Rita and Whatsit&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; &lt;/strong&gt;brings understated holiday elegance new meaning with its nearly minimalist illustrations of black and white, with splashes of red accent. Rita and her dog Whatsit prepare for Christmas. They write a letter to Santa. &amp;#8220;Whatsit doesn&amp;#8217;t want much: a chewy ball, a police dog uniform, some dog biscuits, some cat crackers, a treadmill . . . and about a hundred other things.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decorate their small, leaning trees. Whatsit&amp;#8217;s features a &amp;#8220;garland of sausages, slices of salami, and some bologna. It smells wonderful.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; Rita puts together a no-bake cake with cocoa and canned pumpkin  - it resembles a puddle  - for Santa and Whatsit howls &amp;#8220;Silent Night&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; while Rita conducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopeful Rita puts out her stocking and all of her pairs of shoes while Whatsit sets out a chewed slipper. (&amp;#8220;Most of the flavor is gone.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217;) But will Whatsit the vigilant guard dog chase Santa away? Clearly we&amp;#8217;re in for safe sailing and a gentle ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published in France, &amp;#8220;Christmas with Rita and Whatsit&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; maintains its French insouciance. Artist Olivier  Tallec uses  lines like an old master  - combining the best qualities of cartoon, decoration, sketch, and doodle. Author Jean-Philippe Arrou-Vignod&amp;#8217;s ironic humor creates a subtly  charming bit of light holiday play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the holiday list, I always like to include at least one secular book, and Jan Reynolds&amp;#8217; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Cycle of Rice, Cycle of Life: A Story of Sustainable Farming&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; &lt;/strong&gt;is  a photo-picture book about the sanctity of life, sharing, and working together, seen through the cycles of growing and harvesting rice that is so essential to the people of Bali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this island nation in Southeast Asia, the native peoples live in tune with the rhythms of nature and the seasons, taking nothing for granted. Water, for instance. The &amp;#8220;Balinese know they cannot survive without water. It is essential for all life and sacred to their culture.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; For this reason they have temples, and shrines, all giving thanks for the gift of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, the Balinese have developed &amp;#8220;a human-made marvel of hydro engineering,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; a complex system of dams, tunnels, canals, and  aqueducts that has helped them harness their waters. This along with an intricate crop-rotation program has helped Bali become one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest rice producers and most successful practitioners of sustainable farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to California anthropologist J. Stephen Lansing, not only have traditional Balinese growing techniques survived, but new computer models of &amp;#8220;ancient tradition with cutting edge technology&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; are now spreading to other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breathtaking photos of &amp;#8220;Cycle of Rice&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; are stunning golds and greens. They give young readers a glimpse into the details and mechanics of sustainable farming, but more richly, into the lives of people who have learned to live in balance with nature and with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ends with a Balinese blessing: &amp;#8220;May all that breathes be well.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; It&amp;#8217;s a happy thought to take from the end of one year to the beginning of the next. In a season of gift-giving, &amp;#8220;Cycle of Rice, Cycle of Life&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; is a powerful reminder of essential blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liz Rosenberg teaches English at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and her most recent books are the novel &amp;#8220;Home Repair&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; and the forthcoming picture book &amp;#8220;Nobody.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</myarticlebody>
