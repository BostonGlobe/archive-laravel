      <p>Very few truly delightful Christmas books appear in a season, despite the landslide of brave attempts, so when one sparkles along, it&#8217;s a reason for holiday celebration.</p>
      <p>Rob Scotton, best-selling author of &#8220;Splat the Cat&#8217;&#8217; and its sequel, &#8220;Love, Splat,&#8217;&#8217; comes through brilliantly in &#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat.&#8217;&#8217; Everything about this picture book is joyfully simple, from the red, green, and white front cover, to the back cover with nothing but a red Christmas ornament dangling off Splat&#8217;s impossibly curled tail.</p>
      <p>The story line is also simple: It&#8217;s the day before Christmas, and Splat is composing a letter to Santa explaining what a &#8220;really big present&#8217;&#8217; he wants for Christmas and what a &#8220;very good cat&#8217;&#8217; he&#8217;s been all year. His best friend, Seymour the mouse, is suitably impressed, but Splat&#8217;s little sister looks askance at him and gives &#8220;Splat a look that only little sisters can give. &#8216;R-e-a-l-l-y?&#8217; &#8217;&#8217;</p>
      <p>That plants the seed of doubt that sends Splat into a frenzy of last minute helpful behavior that nearly drives his mother crazy and guarantees Splat one very sleepless night - while comically Santa sneaks up on him each time he turns over in bed. Scotton&#8217;s humor is deft and gentle - he never says or shows too much: the teetering tower of Christmas china Splat washes; the way he weirdly redecorates the Christmas tree; that cynical look on his little sister&#8217;s face. Scotton&#8217;s cats are all wonderfully bulgy-eyed, and he can wrestle more expression from an eyeball than other artists can from a whole canvas.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat&#8217;&#8217; will appeal to those who have been very good, those who haven&#8217;t, and anyone who loves the thrill of a good yarn spinning out with perfect color, tone, and timing. I&#8217;d put &#8220;Merry Christmas, Splat&#8217;&#8217; right up against a handful of Christmas children&#8217;s favorites, where I am willing to bet it will hold its own.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Christmas with Rita and Whatsit&#8217;&#8217; brings understated holiday elegance new meaning with its nearly minimalist illustrations of black and white, with splashes of red accent. Rita and her dog Whatsit prepare for Christmas. They write a letter to Santa. &#8220;Whatsit doesn&#8217;t want much: a chewy ball, a police dog uniform, some dog biscuits, some cat crackers, a treadmill . . . and about a hundred other things.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
      <p>They decorate their small, leaning trees. Whatsit&#8217;s features a &#8220;garland of sausages, slices of salami, and some bologna. It smells wonderful.&#8217;&#8217; Rita puts together a no-bake cake with cocoa and canned pumpkin - it resembles a puddle - for Santa and Whatsit howls &#8220;Silent Night&#8217;&#8217; while Rita conducts.</p>
      <p>Hopeful Rita puts out her stocking and all of her pairs of shoes while Whatsit sets out a chewed slipper. (&#8220;Most of the flavor is gone.&#8217;&#8217;) But will Whatsit the vigilant guard dog chase Santa away? Clearly we&#8217;re in for safe sailing and a gentle ending.</p>
      <p>Originally published in France, &#8220;Christmas with Rita and Whatsit&#8217;&#8217; maintains its French insouciance. Artist Olivier Tallec uses lines like an old master - combining the best qualities of cartoon, decoration, sketch, and doodle. Author Jean-Philippe Arrou-Vignod&#8217;s ironic humor creates a subtly charming bit of light holiday play.</p>
      <p>For the holiday list, I always like to include at least one secular book, and Jan Reynolds&#8217; &#8220;Cycle of Rice, Cycle of Life: A Story of Sustainable Farming&#8217;&#8217; is a photo-picture book about the sanctity of life, sharing, and working together, seen through the cycles of growing and harvesting rice that is so essential to the people of Bali.</p>
      <p>On this island nation in Southeast Asia, the native peoples live in tune with the rhythms of nature and the seasons, taking nothing for granted. Water, for instance. The &#8220;Balinese know they cannot survive without water. It is essential for all life and sacred to their culture.&#8217;&#8217; For this reason they have temples, and shrines, all giving thanks for the gift of water.</p>
      <p>Over the centuries, the Balinese have developed &#8220;a human-made marvel of hydro engineering,&#8217;&#8217; a complex system of dams, tunnels, canals, and aqueducts that has helped them harness their waters. This along with an intricate crop-rotation program has helped Bali become one of the world&#8217;s largest rice producers and most successful practitioners of sustainable farming.</p>
      <p>Thanks to California anthropologist J. Stephen Lansing, not only have traditional Balinese growing techniques survived, but new computer models of &#8220;ancient tradition with cutting edge technology&#8217;&#8217; are now spreading to other parts of the world.</p>
      <p>The breathtaking photos of &#8220;Cycle of Rice&#8217;&#8217; are stunning golds and greens. They give young readers a glimpse into the details and mechanics of sustainable farming, but more richly, into the lives of people who have learned to live in balance with nature and with each other.</p>
      <p>The book ends with a Balinese blessing: &#8220;May all that breathes be well.&#8217;&#8217; It&#8217;s a happy thought to take from the end of one year to the beginning of the next. In a season of gift-giving, &#8220;Cycle of Rice, Cycle of Life&#8217;&#8217; is a powerful reminder of essential blessings.</p>
      <p>Liz Rosenberg teaches English at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and her most recent books are the novel &#8220;Home Repair&#8217;&#8217; and the forthcoming picture book &#8220;Nobody.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
