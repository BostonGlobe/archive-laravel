<div class="story"><p>Polly Dagget raced up Beach Street, her long skirts hiked up to her shins, her bonnet bouncing on her shoulders while the bright June sunshine frolicked in her loose auburn hair. Two British Regulars flanking the entrance to the Marine Hospital eyed her with good-humored curiosity. Overhead, a pair of laughing gulls chuckled as they floated on the currents that wafted in from Vineyard Sound. "Polly Daggett!" a merry voice called out as Polly turned north along the main way of Homse's Hole. "Where are you headed in such haste? Is the devil nipping at your heels?" It was her dear friend Parnell Manter, shepherding a passel of younger brothers and sisters home from an outing.</p><p>Polly paused to catch her breath, then looked around cautiously to be sure no British troops were in earshot. She pulled Parnell a bit apart from the younger children.</p><p>"Oh, Nell," she whispered. "I was down at the dock when the ferry came in. The British have closed the port of Boston!"</p><p>"Closed?" Nell's smile faded. "Are you certain?"</p><p>"Yes," Polly whispered. "King George is furious over that Boston <i>tea party. </i> He has decreed that no ships shall be allowed in or out of Boston Harbor until the tea is paid for -- not even fishing boats!"</p><p>"Then the tea must be paid for in all haste," said Nell matter-of-factly, "else the people of Boston will starve."</p><p>Polly frowned. Though Nell was only two years above her 12, the girls sometimes seemed generations apart. Nell was as even-tempered and practical as Polly was high-spirited and given to flights of fancy.  Perhaps it was because Nell was the oldest of nine children, while Polly was the youngest of seven.</p><p>"You don't understand," Polly went on. "There is far more to the punishment. Throughout the colonies, we are to have no more town meetings, nor are we allowed to elect our local officials. They will now be appointed by the king's governor, and anyone accused of a crime, justly or not, must be shipped off to England for trial. More troops are already on their way to enforce these new laws, and they are to be quartered in our own homes!"</p><p>Nell's face grew grave.</p><p>"The colonists will never countenance such laws," she said.</p><p>"Nor should they," Polly declared. "They are already calling them the Intolerable Acts."</p><p>Polly and Nell had reached the front gate of the Manter homestead.</p><p>"Where are you off to with this news?" Nell inquired.</p><p>"Just down the lane to Allen's Tavern," said Polly. "Father is working there on the new addition. I want to be the first to tell him."</p><p>"Wait a moment then," said Nell, "and let me get my shawl. I'll come and visit with Maria."</p><p>Maria was the third friend in a trio that Polly's mother had dubbed "three peas in a pod,"  not because the three were so much alike, but because they were always together. Maria was the same age as Nell, and also one of the oldest siblings in her large family, but Maria had a streak of lively mischief in her that Polly could arouse with a bit of effort.</p><p>Physically, Maria was the most pea-like of the three, short and prettily plump with golden hair and apple cheeks. She had a quick smile and a spirited laugh that made her the darling of the patrons of her father's tavern.</p><p>Nell was more pod-like than pea-like, tall and slender, with chestnut hair and great brown eyes. She was pensive and mysterious, and carried herself with an easy elegance that was already turning the heads of the men and boys of Martha's Vineyard.</p><p>Polly herself resembled neither pod nor pea, but perhaps a little leafhopper that might hide amid the greens in the vegetable patch. Small and wiry, with freckled skin, green eyes, and a breathless exuberance, she found it nearly impossible to walk more than two steps without breaking into a trot.</p><p>Whereas the older girls had begun to change into young women, Polly still looked and acted the child. In truth, though, nature had begun stirring in her as well, much as she tried to ignore it. Somehow, all of this odd chemistry worked and the three girls were fast friends.</p><p>"Well, hurry then if you want to come along," Polly told Nell.</p><p>Nell flashed her patient smile and herded her young charges through the gate and into the Manter house. Polly danced impatiently from foot to foot as she waited for her friend to reappear. Down at the ferry stage, she could see the ferry slowly putting out to sea again. It passed several pilot boats, a dozen or so whaling skiffs, a brig, a schooner, a British man-of-war, and an assortment of other craft riding peacefully at anchor. The fishing fleet had not yet come home for the day.</p><p>Homse's Hole was a small settlement on the northerly side of the island of Martha's Vineyard, directly across Vineyard Sound from Falmouth, in Massachusetts Bay Colony. Homse meant "old man" and referred to an elderly Indian man who had lived on a bluff overlooking the harbor, or "hole," when the first English settlers arrived. The little settlement consisted of roughly 40 homesteads, and the lives of most of its 225 citizens revolved around the sea. Vineyarders were a hardy lot, clinging to their little spit of land through sun and wind and storm. They were whaling captains, shipwrights, sailmakers, fishermen, farmers, coopers, rope makers, riggers, and most certainly tavern keepers, for at any one time the population of the little town doubled if one counted all the transient seamen that frequented the Hole to rest and refresh themselves, outfit and repair their ships, or to recuperate at the Marine Hospital.</p><p>Like most other Americans, the folks of Homse's Hole valued their rights as Englishmen and believed that they should be in control of their own destinies. Distracted by a war with France, England had given her American colonies unprecedented freedom for many years. They had been allowed to set up their own legislatures, elect their own representatives, pass their own laws, and levy their own taxes. Once the colonists had tasted such freedoms, there was no turning back. In 1765, when England levied a Stamp Tax on the colonies to help pay for the French and Indian War, the response had been outrage. "No taxation without representation!," Americans declared.</p><p>In the nine years since, things had gone from bad to worse, with the colonists revolting in many ways and England retaliating by taking away more and more freedoms. Many Americans were now saying that the breech was beyond repair and calling for outright war with England. Last December, Bostonians had shown their disdain by dumping three shiploads of British tea into the harbor rather than pay King George's tax. Now England had responded. Polly knew these latest sanctions were sure to bring war closer to reality.</p><p>Nell returned at last, knotting her shawl delicately about her shoulders.</p><p>"It's about time," said Polly, grabbing her friend's hand and dragging her off in the direction of Allen's Tavern.</p><p>When they arrived, Nell went around to the keeping room to find Maria. Polly followed the sound of hammering to the newly framed addition at the back of the tavern.</p><p>"Papa!," she shouted, poking her head in through the open doorway. "The ferry . . ." Then she stopped midsentence and blushed. On his knees, helping her father lay floorboards, was Maria's older brother, Caleb. Polly had adored Caleb for as long as she could remember. He had always treated her like a little sister, teasing her and spoiling her and looking out for her more than her own six brothers did. Lately, though, Polly's sisterly feelings for Caleb had changed. She found herself tongue-tied in his presence and flustered at his touch, and secretly, in the privacy of her bedchamber, she had taken to writing the names "Polly" and "Allen"  on her slate just to see how they looked together. They looked fine, she thought, and they trilled like music when you spoke them out loud. "Polly Allen." Her young heart would swell at the sound, but then it would quickly sink again, for she had seen all too often and all too clearly the way Caleb's eyes glowed whenever Nell came into sight.</p>
