<div class="story"><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Initially, I was planning on going to a number of international destinations including Chernobyl, the Sudan, and Kosovo.  Eventually, however, I decided that the book would be more focused if I selected only American stories.  I felt that this would give the stories in my book an added level of continuity.  I also was pretty damn scared about visiting the so-called &#147;dead zone&#148; in Chernobyl where the radiation is still really hot.  Even the active volcano in Hawaii (that I eventually visited) seemed safe by contrast.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;I'm very curious about your writing habits.  You're so young and yet you've achieved so much.   What's your writing schedule like?  How many hours do you put in each day?  Do you have any advice to someone who struggles to sit down and get writing?  Look forward to your answer.&nbsp;&mdash;Eve, Somerville, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;My schedule is pretty erratic, depending on whether I am on the road reporting, but generally I wake up around 6:30 am, drive my wife to work at the hospital (she is a resident at Bingham & Women&#146;s) and then head back home.  This is my commute to work because I actually work at home!  Once home, I check my e-mail, read the headlines on the paper, and then set to work writing.  I usually write for two hours and then take a break, usually calling a friend and sipping some tea for about 20 minutes.  Then I head back to work and write for another 2-2.5 hours.  Then I&#146;m done writing.  In the afternoons I either read or try to do something athletic like run or lift weights.  I try not to work on weekends.  But I write every workday whether it feels good or not.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;When you are beginning to write a novel, do you create a written outline first or do you just write and re-write and re-write?&nbsp;&mdash;J Delaney, Chestnut Hill</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Technically, I don&#146;t write novels, I only write nonfiction, which is by definition not a novel.  That being said, in my nonfiction writing, I always use an outline.  It is the only way to organize all of the hundreds of bits of information that I incorporate into my stories.  Outlines may not be very romantic sounding, but they are the scaffolding to my work, and without them the story would never stand.  So yes, I always use them.  Like doing the 13th re-write, such elements of writing are dull but necessary.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;What was your favorite locale? Does your response surprise you?&nbsp;&mdash;Evan, Somerville, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;I really don&#146;t have a favorite.  The volcano in Hawaii was very beautiful and in some ways relaxing, but I wouldn&#146;t call it my favorite.  I liked each place in it&#146;s own way.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;How long have you been writing?  When did you get serious about your work?  Any advice for a novice?&nbsp;&mdash;Sharon, West Hartford, CT</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;During my junior year of college, which was in 1995, I spent six months in Prague.  A few weeks into my stay, I found an apartment and settled into a routine of doing very little -- wandering around the city, reading, and living off the money I'd saved. Almost immediately I sensed that it was a special time to be living there.  The city was teaming with artists, expatriates and lingering tourists, living in two-dollar-a-night hostels.  Everyone there was writing a novel, or a play, or at least some essays.  The apartment that I took over, had been the home of a long string of expatriated Americans before me, and the closets were filled with an array of discarded and abandoned manuscripts, most of them uncompleted.  Something about the city inspired even the least imaginative visitor to create.  The streets had a frenetic energy about them, and the city had a sense of self the way few places do.  During my own time in Prague I dedicated myself to writing a screenplay for a movie.  The screenplay, which was called the Papaya Trap, was about a con artist living who falls in love with a young girl with a pretty serious birth defect.  It was sweet but ultimately unworkable script.  It did, however, give me my first taste of what it would take to write an opus of some length.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;Sorry if this is too personal, but did you find yourself emotionally attached to any of the people in the book? I have not read it yet, but I would think that if you are involved so intensely in such an extreme location with these people, the line between "reporter" and "friend" might blur. Thank you and good luck with what seems like a great book.&nbsp;&mdash;Elaine, Boston, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;I became very close with Thad Knight in Princeville, NC.  I probably know Thad better than any of the other characters in my book because I had several follow-up visits with him.  I came back once with my brother to take photographs, once with my father who was curiosity to meet Thad for himself, and twice more by myself to wrap things up.  Over the course of these revisits I came to know Thad pretty well.  I met all of his children, and many of his grandchildren.  When he took me to church he introduced me as his nephew &#150; which was a bold assertion, considering I&#146;m white and he&#146;s black &#150; but Thad seemed enjoy the small spectacle that this created.  And secretly, I liked the idea of him as my uncle.  Truth be told, I was in better touch with him than with many of my own relatives.  I even called him on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And on Yom Kippur, when my father sat down to write his traditional correspondences to friends and family, he also wrote one to Thad Knight.  I&#146;m not sure what it said, for this was between the two of them, but I know that Thad received the letter and kept it in a drawer with a handful of important things.  Likewise, I stowed away a small headshot of Thad, which he had given me on our first encounter.  Only later did he tell me that it was his only photograph to survive the flood.  I tried to give it back, but he refused.  So in answer to your question, yes the line was blurred here between &#147;reporter&#148; and &#147;friend&#148; which sometimes made it tough when I had to write some ugly truths about Princeville.  Luckily, I had a good editor who helped me and pushed me to stay as objective as possible.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;Hi Jake, You'll probably get asked this a lot, but I am very curious about your next project and if you'll be doing something totally different or something along the same lines. Thanks!&nbsp;&mdash;Julian, Boston, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;I  can&#146;t say too much, but I have sold my next book to my publisher, Houghton Mifflin, and the book is on the subject of fame in America.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;How do you feel your experience at Yale University influenced your novel? Were there any specific professors or classes that sparked your literary creativity? How might your novel have been different had you attended an alternate university?&nbsp;&mdash;M. Gross, Boston, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;I had a number of great writing teachers at Yale, but oddly enough, I think that nothing taught me more than my experience as a rower.  Rowing is perhaps the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  We started in the fall and trained three hours a day, every day, right through the end of spring.  We lifted weights, ran stadiums, swam laps, rowed through ice and snow &#150; and all of it was ostensibly for the ultimate goal of beating either Harvard or Princeton in May at Eastern Sprints.  The thing is, you can&#146;t row only with the aim of winning Eastern Sprints.  I remember my coach saying: You&#146;ve got to love rowing every day or it&#146;s just not worth it.  And that&#146;s largely the way I view writing.  It is very rare that you have a book party or a reading at a bookstore.  It is very rare that your story makes the cover of the magazine.  And it doesn&#146;t make sense to live for that.  You&#146;ve got to enjoy the process every day, and that&#146;s what I try to do.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;How did the idea for the book come to you? Did you grow up in or near one of these towns, or a town like it?&nbsp;&mdash;Matthew, Sudbury, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Shortly after college, I spent a year in Israel where I taught English and worked as a free-lance journalist.  During that time, I wrote a story about the Jewish settlers living in Hebron.  Many of them lived in crowded tin trailers, surrounded by barbed wire fences and watch posts, in a setting than looked more like Auschwitz than Israel.  The whole arrangement was pretty grim and I failed to see how anyone could be so attached to such hellish environs.</p><p>When most people think of diehards making stands over turf, they tend to think of situations like this, where fierce religious conflict has bred a stubborn devotion to the land.  Yet upon my return to the United States, I began to wonder whether there might not be something more universal about the desire to keep one&#146;s home &#150; even in the face of the most monstrous conditions.  I wondered if there weren&#146;t stories somewhat like this being played out right under our noses.</p><p>I soon found such a story in the town of Centralia, Pennsylvania &#150; a place where the ground has literally been on fire for over thirty years.  In Centralia, I met Lamar Mervine, the town&#146;s eighty-two year old mayor, who recounted how Centralia&#146;s coal mines had caught fire, causing giant sinkholes to from and carbon monoxide to spew from the earth.  Eventually the entire town was evacuated, except for Lamar and a handful of others who refused to move.  The Centralia story intrigued me, and before I knew it I was investigating a number of other hotspots across the U.S.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;Of all of the places that are featured in your book, which could you pictures yourself living in the most, and why?&nbsp;&mdash;Emily, Somerville, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;I don&#146;t really think I could see myself living in any of these places.  In large part, this is because I have come to realize that the word &#147;home&#148; means something very different to me than it does to the people in my book.  For them, home is permanent &#150; like family, or genetics, or a vivid memory &#150; it is something that is simply a part of who you are.  Practicality is a moot point.  It just doesn&#146;t factor into their definition of home.  And this was a big thing for me to realize: We were operating under vastly different definitions of what the word &#147;home&#148; meant.  So I really can&#146;t imagine switching places with any of the people in my book, but I&#146;ve certainly come to appreciate what they&#146;re fighting for.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;Was there one certain person/place/event that made you realize you had to write this book, or was it more of a combination of things?  At what point did you know you had to get this down in book form?  Thanks!&nbsp;&mdash;Amanda, Cambridge, MA</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Well, I dreamt up the idea for this book within the confines of my cubicle at The New Republic.  I pitched the idea for the first time while doing a stint as an operator on the magazine&#146;s switchboard (a right of passage for all the young grunts in the office).  The magazine&#146;s publicist, who was on hold for the editor, agreed to listen to my idea &#150; and before I knew it I was talking to publishers.  Then one day it occurred it me that I would actually have to visit the places that I had researched.  Suddenly my mother was asking me about life insurance and how dangerous molten lava could be.  A mild panic came over me.  It was one thing to daydream about this in my Washington D.C. cubicle; it was another thing to take up residence in a house that rested precariously in the hearth of an erupting volcano.  Who would possibly want to do that, and why?  And this, of course, was the point.  I wanted to find out.  I distinctly remember getting on the plane and heading off to Whittier, Alaska, for the first time.  And I think this way my moment of realization, when I determined, yes I am really going to do this.  It was a scary moment.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;Jake, I'm just curious which authors inspire you and why?&nbsp;&mdash;Stacy, South Boston</p><p><font size="4"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;In non-fiction my heroes are Ted Conover, Tony Horwitz, and Jon Lee Anderson (all of whom write journalism for the New Yorker, and have published some great books).  In fiction my heroes are Robert Stone and John Steinbeck.</p>
