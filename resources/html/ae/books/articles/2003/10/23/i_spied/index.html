<div class="story"><p>"Wassup?" was the first interview question she was asked, closely followed by, "Why would you want to do this?"</p><p>To Gray, who had grown up in Newton on a steady diet of Nancy Drew books, the world of private investigation seemed like a perfect fit. It would allow her to use the childhood skills she had perfected while carrying out her favorite game: spying on the neighbors. The children's book "Harriet the Spy" was her bible. "I'm nosy, and I'm a fantastic gossip," she says.</p><p>And in the blue-collar, testosterone-driven world of private investigating, she could be darn sure she wouldn't be taking dictation about dinner parties. Gray's new book, "Spygirl" (published by Random House's Villard Books division), is a memoir of the three years she spent at what she calls The Agency, a Manhattan private investigating firm. The book offers a funny, sometimes depressing look at life in the big city as told by a 20-something looking for bad guys, whom she finds in both her professional and personal lives.</p><p>Gray attended the Winsor School in Boston and went on to Brown University, where she majored in English. After graduating in 1997, she headed to New York, seeking excitement but finding crummy jobs, steep rents, and paltry pay. She was thrilled when she broke into the world of private investigating, which she felt was in her DNA. Her father, Paul, is a professor of sociology at Boston College; her mother, Leigh, is a psychotherapist.</p><p>"Every dinner conversation was analyzing what makes people do things, other people and ourselves," she recalls. "It does fascinate me, what makes people feel they need to lie about themselves."</p><p>Her parents say they are impressed with the book but not surprised. Amy, they recall, loved to both spy and write as a child. "She would always overhear parts of conversations in the next room and demand to know what was going on," says Leigh Gray. "She wasn't like a pathological Peeping Tom. She was just endlessly curious and invented games about spying and investigation."</p><p>Though they didn't love the idea of her moving to New York, they've "adapted," says her father. They were less concerned about her detective work than they were about her riding the New York City subways.</p><p>Amy Gray, now 28, says she was at first attracted to the job by the black and white of it: the good guys vs. the bad guys. But she soon learned that the moral compass wasn't so clear. Sometimes she identified more with the people she was investigating than with her clients. "Because I was still figuring out who I was, I sometimes felt like a fraud -- like I was trying on selves like new outfits," she says, her legs propped on a glass coffee table. "In a way, criminals and liars are engaged in this process to the extreme."</p><p>And sometimes her clients' cluelessness irritated her. "I found it frustrating that people could be so gullible and such willing victims to some of these absurd crimes," she says. In one case, a man claimed to have worked on Wall Street for 25 years and almost scammed investors for more than $1 million before The Agency discovered that he'd been working as a hot dog vendor, not a bonds trader.</p><p>The Agency was not your "Magnum, P.I." shop, with derring-do involving back alleys and drawn guns. (Gray confides that she's afraid of guns and has fired a rifle only "at the shooting range at Camp Three Pines when I was 12.") The Agency instead concentrated on white-collar clients, many of them venture capitalists trying to protect their investments. Gray had joined the firm at the peak of the dot-com madness, which accounted for much of their business.</p><p>"The guys we investigated at these companies were so young that they barely had college degrees, let alone paper trails and business histories that showed anything but their ability to hold down a summer job at Vail or flip burgers," she writes in her book.</p><p>Gray did much of her snooping on the computer, supplementing her paper findings through personal interviews with disgruntled ex-employees, business partners, lovers, and others who might have a reason to spill the goods. (Yes, she did wear a trench coat in cool weather.)</p><p>From the living room of her sixth-floor walk-up on the Lower East Side, she has a killer view of the Empire State, Chrysler, and Citicorp buildings. She gives a quick tour of the small apartment. The front room she calls "the living room/dining room/kitchen/library." Starlings flutter at the window; Gray has been trying to hand-tame them. Down on the street, a man with long blond braids combs through trash bins, and people come and go from a Spanish mission across the street. Alphabet City, as it's called, is a gritty, mixed neighborhood, and Gray loves it.</p><p>"I think people feel comfortable talking to me," Gray says. "I'm the unofficial therapist to my friends. A lot of people I interviewed had been through horrible trauma with the person we were investigating. I'd say, `Listen, if you can help us with this, we can prevent the same thing from happening to others.' "</p><p>Sometimes it seemed the entire city was full of con artists. "People who seem to be born-and-bred New Yorkers usually are from Jersey," she writes. "Take a drug addiction, a failed hedge fund, a series of failed actings bids and start anew: a political career, a new debt-consolidation company, a hit movie."</p><p>Her first case involved a dot-com exec who was deducting his luxury home and pool as work expenses. It wasn't sensational stuff, but Gray was excited. "I was like, `Wow! I hit the jackpot! I totally busted him!' " But her client, one of the company's investors, went ahead with the deal anyway, telling her, "We all do stuff like that."</p><p>Another customer was a high-powered New York wedding planner who was suspicious of a couple who had hired her. Gray poked around, eventually learning that the "multimillionaire" groom-to-be was a convicted felon in two states. Soon the guy headed back to jail instead of the altar, wanted on outstanding warrants.</p><p>One memorable case involved a European heir who had squandered his family's fortune then tried to con some New York businessmen. After compiling a case against him and presenting it to her clients, Gray was stunned to read of his suicide in the New York Post, as she stood with other strap-hangers on the F train. She burst into tears. "I was extremely disturbed," she says. "I felt I'd played a role in it."</p><p>During her days as a gumshoe, she investigated a dot-commer who was a polygamist, another who was moonlighting as a male escort, and a hip-hop star who was involved financially with a shady underworld type.</p><p>If the cast of characters she investigated was colorful, they couldn't match her colleagues, who toiled in a grungy loft with broken windowpanes, sticky insect tape, and rat traps -- a stark contrast to the corporate publishing world she had inhabited. As she entered the building for her first day of work, she nearly collided with her boss, who was chasing a former client down the stairs with a baseball bat. In her book, there was no need to embellish the characters, she says. "In fact, I had to tone it down, they were so outrageous."</p><p>One of her co-workers, Amber Smith, confirms Gray's account. "They were definitely colorful characters, in an endearing way," she says. Smith, who has since left The Agency, says though some of her former colleagues feel "a bit sensitive and maybe envious" over their lives' being written about, most have been supportive. "I loved the book," she says. "There were parts she had to rearrange for confidentiality, but it is largely true."</p><p>In her book, Gray writes about her first day on the job, when she and another new hire got fingerprinted. The other recruit was visibly nervous, explaining that he'd been arrested in high school for public drunkenness and lewd behavior. "That's the kind of stuff we <i>hire</i> you for," said a boss, who had overheard.</p><p>Then there was the Odd Days Club, a longstanding company tradition that consisted of drinking till the wee hours, on odd-numbered days, in the Chelsea loft. Another time, in a bar, she spotted a senior investigator shaking his booty in a zebra-striped G-string on amateur night.</p><p>"It's such an incredibly fertile place to write about," she says of The Agency. "The raucousness of it, the playfulness of it. It's honestly a one-of-a-kind place."</p><p>If the book is about rooting out bad guys, it's also about rooting out good guys -- for boyfriend material. It's not as racy as "Sex and the City," but Gray's search for Mr. Right -- or even Mr. Adequate -- is peopled with losers and quasi losers. There are long nights at sketchy bars, bad pickup lines, and worse hangovers. It's a gothic coming-of-age story for the 20-something set.</p><p>In the end, Gray finds her true love only to almost lose him when she decides to snoop on him via his computer -- curiosity plus occupational habit. "After a lot of bad dating experiences, you're very mistrustful of people," she explains. From one of his old files, she concluded that he had a crush on a friend of hers. When she confronted him with the evidence, he was furious, telling her she'd betrayed his trust and was a lousy investigator. (He had only briefly been attracted to the friend years earlier.)</p><p>Gray and the man have now been living together for more than two years. Peter Buchanan-Smith is a graphics designer who owns a nonprofit book publishing company. Is his girlfriend still nosy? He pauses. "Yes, she is. But not in a bothersome way. Now it's just out of concern. I don't find it annoying." He adds: "Now I make sure I get everything on the table so there are no dark trails she can snoop down."</p><p>Gray does freelance writing now and would love to go back to investigating. But with her book that lets it all hang out about that world, she's not sure she's "hirable." And anyway, with the crash of the dot-com market, the cases today tend to be boring, due-diligence stuff, she says.</p><p>Meanwhile, she can still snoop at home. Pointing out her bathroom window, she says of her neighbors: "I know <i>way</i> too much about them."</p><p><span class="tagline">   Amy Gray will read from "Spygirl" on Monday at 7 p.m. at the Harvard Coop in Cambridge.</span></p>
