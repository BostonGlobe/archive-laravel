<span class="story"><p><h3>The story so far:</h3></p><p>In 1774, when the British close the port of Boston as punishment for the Boston Tea Party, people in the small fising town of Homse's Hole on Martha's Vineyard are outraged. The men meet secrtetly at Seth Daggett's house to discuss the matter, while  unbeknownst to them, Daggett's daughter, Polly , and her friends Nella nd Maria have organized the women in the town to dump all their tea into the ocean in protest against the British.</p><p><h2>An invitation to tea</h2></p><p>It was four o'clock -- tea time -- when they poured out of their houses into the street, their numbers swelling as they drew closer and closer to the ferry landing. Grandmothers, mothers, daughters, all walking with chins held high. The bright June sun glinted off their starched bonnets and white mobcaps. Their long skirts rustled as they strode purposefully down the rutted, dusty lanes of Homse's Hole. Short, tall, thin, broad, young, old. Some held babies, some tugged toddlers. The elderly walked with canes, or leaned on the arm of a friend. They carried boxes and sacks, canisters and pots, anything that might hold a bit of tea.</p><p>At the front  marched the three self-proclaimed Daughters of Liberty with Polly Daggett in the lead.</p><p>Carpenters stopped hammering mid-swing, farmers leaned over their fences, shopkeepers appeared in their doorways, soldiers and sailors paused in the midst of their appointed tasks and stared. Horses and carts scurried out of the way. Dogs barked. Soon men and boys of all ages were shuffling along beside the group, calling out names, laughing, jeering, and shouting questions.</p><p>"Mary, my girl, where are you off to in such a hurry?"</p><p>"Mrs. West, I demand to know the meaning of this!"</p><p>"What have we here ladies, a petticoat brigade?"</p><p>"You're not leaving us one and all, are you lasses?"</p><p>"Maria! Nell! Polly!"</p><p>Polly's head turned. Caleb Allen was coming out of the feed store with a sack of grain over his shoulder. He stopped and dropped the sack to the ground.</p><p>"What in the name of liberty are you up to?"</p><p>Polly just smiled and kept on marching along the main way, down Beach Street, straight for the ferry landing where Captain Chase was unloading his day's cargo of goods and passengers.</p><p>The two British Regulars who were inspecting the crates and barrels looked up, startled, as the flock of women swooped down upon them.</p><p>"Halt!" one shouted. The two moved quickly and Polly found herself toe to toe with a tall Redcoat, his gun held out horizontal to bar her way. Beside him, the other soldier did the same, the two together blocking the women from gaining the ferry ramp.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" the senior officer demanded.</p><p>"Just a little outing, sir," replied Sarah Manter, who was right behind Nell. "Surely, you won't deny a group of gentlewomen the pleasure of taking a bit of sea air."</p><p>The Redcoats exchanged suspicious glances.</p><p>"What are those bundles you carry?" the officer demanded.</p><p>"Just a bit of refreshment," Nell's mother said sweetly.</p><p>"Aye," added Sarah Allen in a sharper tone. She pushed her way forward. "And if you don't let us pass, it'll be a cold day in July before <i>you</i> find a bit of refreshment in my tavern again."</p><p>"Or an ear to tell your troubles to," said Charity Williams, a comely lass who worked as an indentured servant at Allen's Tavern. She flashed her flirtatious smile at the soldiers.</p><p>The male onlookers began to chuckle and nudge each other.</p><p>"Silence!" the senior officer demanded, and the group grew quiet again.</p><p>"Oh, come now, officer," said Charity. She pressed forward and put a hand on the soldier's sleeve. "We have no weapons as you can plainly see. What danger can a handful of women and girls pose?"</p><p>The soldier studied her a long moment, then broke into a grudging smile. He shrugged to his fellow officer.</p><p>"Let them pass," he said. "I've a mind to see what manner of bug they've got in their bonnets."</p><p>The soldiers parted and without so much as an "If you please?" to Captain Chase, Polly led her little brigade up the ramp and onto his ferry boat.</p><p>"What? Why? Hey!" Captain Chase sputtered as dozens of damsels crowded aboard. "What about my regular passengers? I've got a schedule to keep."</p><p>"Just put out into the Hole a wee bit please, Captain," said Polly in her high, clear voice. "We won't detain you more than a few minutes."</p><p>"What for?" the Captain demanded.</p><p>"You shall see soon enough, husband," put in Mrs. Chase. "Just do as the child says or you'll find yourself with no one to warm your feet tonight."</p><p>Loud guffaws broke out among the onlookers.</p><p>"Aye, you'd better do as she says, Captain," someone shouted. "Methinks she means it."</p><p>Captain Chase appeared quite confounded, and more than a little disgruntled, but nonetheless, once the last of the company was aboard, he dropped the lines and allowed the ferry to drift out into the harbor.</p><p>"That'll be far enough, thank you love," said Mrs. Chase when the ferry had drifted within shouting distance of the British Man-of-War, Sovereign. Mrs. Chase blew her husband a kiss.</p><p>He swatted the kiss away and dropped anchor.</p><p>"Ahoy, Sovereign!" shouted Maria's mother.</p><p>"What are you doing?" demanded Captain Chase.</p><p>"Hush," whispered Mrs. Chase.</p><p>A sailor peered over the side rail of Sovereign.</p><p>"We've a present for your captain," Maria's mother shouted.    "Will you call him on deck please?"</p><p>The sailor disappeared and a short while later, the captain and most of the rest of Sovereign's crew appeared at the rail. They regarded the odd little group on the ferry with wide-eyed curiosity.</p><p>"You wished to see me, Madam?" the captain asked.</p><p>Maria's mother looked down at Polly and winked.</p><p>Polly nodded.</p><p>"Yes, Sir," Maria's mother shouted. "We wanted to invite you to tea!"</p><p>With that Polly yanked the lid off her box, jumped up on the ferry rail and dumped her tea into the sea.</p><p>"Tell King George that's what we think of his taxes!" she shouted.</p><p>With whoops and shouts and cries of, "A pox on King George! No more taxes! Long live Liberty!" the other women and girls joined in.</p><p>The captain watched in stony silence, his arms folded across his chest. His men whispered together, making wagers, no doubt, as to what would happen next.</p><p>Back on shore, the menfolk of Homse's Hole watched too, powerless to do anything but wait and see how the escapade played out.</p><p>"You don't think they'll shoot us, do you?" Maria whispered to Polly and Nell.</p><p>"Don't be silly," Polly replied, but in truth, the captain's heavy glower was making her stomach flutter. She hoped he wouldn't take his anger out on the men of the village.</p><p>When the last receptacle had been emptied of its contents, the women quieted and stood staring up at the ship, awaiting the captain's response. He frowned at them a long moment, then lifted his eyes to the shore.</p><p>"Is this what manner of men Vineyarders be?" he bellowed. "Sending women to speak your minds!"</p><p>Captain Chase strode to the bow of the ferry.</p><p>"I can assure you, Captain," he declared. "The men of Homse's Hole do not hide behind women's skirts. We had no hand in this. When and if we have a quarrel with the British, you can rest assured that we will take it up with you man to man!"</p><p>The British captain considered this thoughtfully, then, to Polly's relief, seemed to accept it. He turned his attention back to the women.</p><p>"Well, my good women," he said. "I thank you for the diversion. Since the tea you poured into the sea is already paid for, you were perfectly free to do with it as you wished. King George's coffers will be none the worse for your little performance, but I trust your men may be less than pleased to see their last store of tea, dearly bought and paid for, drifting out with the tide. Now, if you'll excuse me. Good day!"</p><p>With that he abruptly turned and disappeared from the rail. The other sailors hung on, laughing and jeering.</p><p>Polly's shoulders sagged.</p><p>"They didn't care," she said incredulously. "They didn't care a whit."</p><p>Maria and Nell looked equally deflated.</p><p>"Never you mind, girls," said Maria's mother, her chin held high. "We showed 'em. We showed 'em good. They know where the women of Homse's Hole stand now."</p><p>"Hear! Hear!" the other women cheered.</p><p>"And we had a jolly good time doing it too, didn't we?" Polly's mother cried.</p><p>"Aye!" someone else shouted. "They won't tread on us again!"</p><p>The women all began cheering and whooping once more, and Polly, Maria, and Nell joined in. Their mothers were right, Polly realized. They had taken a stand, and that's what mattered. So what if they'd wasted their own tea? Small price to pay for standing up for liberty!</p><p>As the ferry approached the shore again, Polly realized something else. The men of Homse's Hole were cheering, too! And right out front was Caleb.</p>
