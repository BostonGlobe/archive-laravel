<div class="story"><p>Modern medicine is ailing. Something is seriously wrong. This is felt not only by patients but also by doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators. Yet there is disagreement about the diagnosis of medicine's malady. Some contend that it is a deep structural problem, that  health care is distributed in erratic and uneven ways, and that nothing less than drastic surgery on the whole system must be done. Others assert that the sickness relates to the mission of medicine, which has been poisoned by money. Until hospitals and clinicians can be purged of the primary imperative of profit, the prognosis will be poor. And then there are those who see the problem mainly as a sapping of medicine's spirit: The traditional esteem and authority accorded to health care professionals have been lost, and  until these attributes are restored, the commitment of doctors and nurses will continue to wither. Only after the culture of caregivers is reaffirmed can its structural problems and the misdirected financial drivers be effectively remedied.</p><p>''Health Wars: On the Global Front Lines of Modern Medicine" is a book that seeks to accurately diagnose what is wrong with medicine today, and offer a framework for solutions. Its author, Richard Horton, is a British physician who edits The Lancet, a weekly medical journal, and also teaches at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In the tradition of English intellectuals, he is erudite and iconoclastic, cloaking often caustic criticism of health care institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and physicians in wry witticisms and wide-ranging references. What distinguishes Horton from many other smart people who cut deep to the bone as they argue contentious subjects in print is that he invites pointed criticism of his own position: ''I wanted to call this book 'Wretched Arguments at the Sick-Bed,' in homage to my hero, Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), who leveled many correctly trenchant criticisms against doctors and the medicine of his day. Wiser publishing heads prevailed. But that is nevertheless what this book is about. Wretched arguments about human disease, debates that I passionately believe are central to an understanding of our most personal worlds as well as global society. The best that I can hope for, if you read any part of this book, is that you will strongly take issue with me."  Horton's challenge to contest his thinking is not easily met, because he examines every argument from three sides.</p><p>Horton's primary thesis is expressed by a play on the word ''disease." Doctors are trained in medical school and residency to focus squarely on the diseases of their patients. The explosion in scientific information about the sequences of genes, the foldings of proteins, and the organization of cells has made this focus even more sharp and penetrating. While in the past physicians relied heavily on the spoken history of symptoms offered by the sick and their families, and then pursued these clues in the bedside examination using centuries-old instruments like stethoscopes and millennia-old approaches like palpation of the organs, technology now permits the physician largely to skip such time-intensive practices and jump to a CAT scan to visualize the inner anatomy of the patient and to DNA analysis of his tissues to pinpoint what is wrong. Horton asserts that this concentration on marvelous science overlooks the soul. In addition to paying attention to disease, he says, a doctor must understand his patient's anguish, his ''dis-ease."</p><p>This position, Horton emphasizes, goes against the tide of so-called evidence-based medicine. And evidence-based medicine is all the rage these days, the core of medical-school curriculums at our most prestigious institutions. ''Evidence-based medicine is a movement that aims to quell what its more extreme supporters see as two malevolent attitudes in medicine," he writes. ''One is that the favored basic science for medicine is done in the laboratory. Respectable medical researchers point themselves toward the bench, not the bedside. . . . The other attitude concerns the power of and respect for the clinical professor, awarded by virtue of his or her long experience. Proponents of evidence-based medicine wish to set experience in its proper place and thus to democratize practice. The most junior medical student is free to know more medicine than the most experienced professor simply because the student has taken the time to study the best evidence rather than rely on the prejudices of hazy and lazy memory." Horton appreciates the need for data in decision making, and is remarkably candid about how new information threatens the old guard of physicians: ''Unsurprisingly, many within the senior professoriate of medicine rather resent the discomfort brought about by skeptical students or junior colleagues. But [there are] compelling arguments in favor of rigorous evidence-based practice: valid information is obviously essential for effective patient care; traditional sources of information -- out-of-date textbooks, biased expert opinions, and ineffective didactic tuition -- are often useless; and while clinical skills may improve over time, scientific knowledge usually withers surprisingly fast. Evidence-based medicine also aims to supplant the traditional apprenticeship model of medical learning."</p><p>Yet humans are not consistently rational beings, and the physicians who practice medicine and the patients who receive care are both deeply human. Horton shows how powerful the irrational is in our public health, and how feeble evidence may be in influencing the salubrity of society. For example, he writes, stopping smoking, tackling obesity, reducing high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and controlling diabetes have all been shown to prevent heart disease; dozens of drugs are available to manage these underlying conditions; and yet the prevalence of each actually rose in Europe in the late '90s.  ''These findings prove that even when a huge amount of original and conclusive scientific evidence is available, its impact on clinical practice can be almost nil." In the past, doctors were honored for their clinical intuition that came from decades of experience at the bedside. This has been devalued in the cold calculus of health care economics and distribution. ''Today, experience is regarded as something of a sin to be repented for -- it is at best an old-fashioned way to practice, at worst, dangerous. In our new quantitative world-view of medicine, experience is out because it cannot be measured, packaged, examined, manipulated, or tested experimentally or statistically. Experience exists only in the mind. In hierarchies of valid evidence, experience sits at the bottom, the weak associate of scientifically acquired evidence."</p><p>Horton rejects this trend, and asserts that intuition, how a doctor ''feels" about a patient and his condition, needs to be a potent factor in diagnosis and treatment: ''Intuition is about as unscientific as one can get in writing about reliable evidence. But in medicine, as in many practical disciplines, intuition is a powerful tool in the right hands." Horton invokes the British philosopher John Locke, who began his classification of degrees of knowledge with the intuitive faculty of the human mind. I would extend Horton's argument and point out that the art of medicine goes beyond cognitive philosophy. Clinical care pivots on narratives, the narratives of the patient's life, that link his past to his present and that project his future. Such narratives fall outside of statistically analyzed experimental evidence, the evidence that this generation of doctors is taught to primarily invoke when offering options for treatment.</p><p>To reincorporate narratives into the doctor--patient encounter, and to provide the fertile environment for intuition, requires time, perhaps the most precious commodity in modern medicine. There seems to be scant time afforded to allow a patient to speak in what is often a disconnected and seemingly meandering way, but which can reveal key clues not only about an underlying physical condition but also his beliefs, attitudes, and needs. And it is  a person's beliefs, attitudes, and  state of mind that will determine how readily he follows a treatment regimen and how successfully he can endure an illness. ''It is time for time, and the judgment that it permits," Horton writes, ''to be taken more seriously. This change is necessary if medicine is to retain its place as society's chief source of healing. It is by no means certain that it will do so." In sharp strokes, Horton sketches such concerns and complexities in the introduction to the book. What follows is a collection of essays, some previously published in The New York Review of Books, The Lancet, The Times Literary Supplement, and London Review of Books, but all updated. The updates breathe a vitality into the tome, presenting the latest information on SARS, AIDS, and bioterrorism. But, in the spirit of invited criticism and disagreement, here is my major complaint: The book abruptly shifts from its intimate and insightful introduction that probes the psyche of the individual patient and his doctor to several hundred pages of discourse about global health. These chapters admittedly address important questions related to the movement of microbes like smallpox and Ebola, and the politics of the often dysfunctional World Health Organization. But the reader feels as if he has been led on a rather long detour away from the personal to the political. Only on page 347 does Horton return to the terrain of the introduction with a chapter entitled ''How Sick is Modern Medicine?" It is as if there are two books stitched together, and it seems to make more sense to follow the introduction with the second half, which centers around the patient, before the first half, which is about society.</p><p>Nonetheless, at the end of the book Horton successfully reveals  the sutures that connect these halves. He makes an argument that human dignity should be the essential fabric of modern medicine. Horton draws heavily on the writings of Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher whose major works were written at the end of the 18th century. In Kant's formulation, the essence of human dignity is autonomy. Dignity, therefore, has no price, and it applies not only to the individual but also to his society. ''Medicine is an important lever for restoring human dignity, at the bedsides of the sick as well as among the world's threatened peoples," Horton concludes. ''The role of the doctor must be to alleviate dis-ease as well as disease, to have the quiet humility to listen when faced with pervasive anxiety, to have the strength to give sustenance when faced with despair, and to have the confidence to act as the voice of one's patient or people, through advocacy, when faced with vulnerability and powerlessness. The restoration of dignity is the end common to all of these endeavors. Amid the many exaggerated scientific claims and harsh political debates that characterize much of modern medicine, this simple idea, so easily overlooked, is the fundamental reason why medicine matters, and why we need to take human dignity a great deal more seriously than we do today."  Amen.</p>
