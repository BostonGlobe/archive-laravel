<span class="story"><p>But that's what happened to Australian writer Peter Finlay, 42, whose pen name is DBC Pierre.  He wrote "Vernon God Little," a satirical "Catcher in the Rye" set in Texas, to prove that his chaotic youth was behind him and that he could succeed at an ambitious creative project. The proof has just won Britain's coveted Man Booker Prize for fiction. The prize means book sales, fame, and $83,000, but to DBC Pierre, its most important meaning is that he no longer has to think of himself as a lazy, irresponsible schlemiel.</p><p>Although the book received many positive US reviews  -- in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, for two -- many American reviewers have scoffed or bridled at its picture of Texas and America generally. British critical favor may partly reflect a current uneasiness with perceived American cultural craziness. The chairman of the Man Booker judges called it "a coruscating black comedy reflecting our alarm but also our fascination with modern America."</p><p>Whatever one thinks of young Vernon's story, DBC Pierre's own adventures have been almost as parlous.  He was in Boston last month  for a reading at Brookline Booksmith, and he had just enough time to tell his life story over a Harp Lager in an Irish pub in the Back Bay. As he sat at a window table, dusk came on, homeward-bound workers hurried past on Boylston Street, and  a tangled <br></br></p><p>tale of Australia, Mexico, Texas, Spain, England, Saudi Arabia, and Ireland unfolded. Born near Adelaide, in South Australia, Pierre spent a year with his family in Washington state, went to school for a year in England, and settled in Mexico City when he was 7. Keith Finlay, his father, was a geneticist at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center in Texcoco, Mexico, directed by agronomist Norman Borlaug, the father of the "Green Revolution." The family was affluent,  spending long stretches of time in the United States, primarily Texas and New York.</p><p>"My folks were good and liberal people who let me run with my own ball," Pierre says in his light Australian accent.  "I was obviously going to be an artist because I could always draw and paint. I was going to be a cartoonist -- I was a fanatic for Peanuts and the Wizard of Id and Beetle Bailey, and was published at 15. But I was lazy. Things were too damn easy -- the house with servants and a swimming pool. I didn't think I had to do anything except sit around and wait for something to happen. And in a curious way, my parents and school permitted that to happen."</p><p>Despite his father's  education, Pierre never went to college. He was fluent in Spanish, and by the time he reached his teens, he had picked up skill at photography to match his drawing. He began hanging out with Mexican rock bands and making money photographing album covers. He was also deep into drugs, mainly amphetamines.</p><p><span class="crosshead">`My life diverged into two'</span> When Pierre was 16, his father fell ill with a brain tumor. "He was the pillar of the family,"  Pierre says.  "Those were the years when he might have kicked my butt and got me in shape, but he wasn't able to do it." Pierre was 19 when his father died. When his mother moved back to Australia to join his older sister, who was married and had children, he stayed in Mexico City. "I had income and a capital basis, from my dad's estate," Pierre says. "I was on prescription drugs and other Mexican things: hallucinogens, peyote, mescalin, and cigarettes and alcohol on top of that." In later years, he became addicted to cocaine.</p><p>His mother had bought property in Spain, and in 1982, while Pierre was visiting her there, the Mexican peso was radically devalued without warning, and most of his father's estate was wiped out.</p><p>Full of bravado at age 21 and determined to be the man of the family, he went back to Mexico to salvage what was left. Unauthorized dollar exports were being controlled by Mexican customs. He closed his father's accounts, converted the pesos to dollars at a good rate offered by a fly-by-night exchange service, sewed the $20,000 in cash into his clothes, then flew to Houston. He met his mother there, gave her the cash, and before she flew home to Australia, he lied and told her that there was much more in Mexico and that he would go back and manage it for her. Big mistake.</p><p>"From that day onward, my life diverged into two," he says. "I had an official life and a real life where this money wasn't. My family would say they needed 10 grand and would say to me, `You said there was still money there.' I would ship it back, and it got to where I was borrowing it, and the pressure of that got me deeper into drugs." He also spent time in Spain, where in a desperate effort to raise cash, he sold a friend's apartment and pocketed the money.</p><p>By the mid-1980s, he was back in Australia, scavenging bits of art and design work, still shoring up his  financial house of cards. Then he hit on a scheme to make a television documentary about Mexico, convinced that the profits from that "would settle everything behind me and float me into a new future as a filmmaker." He borrowed more money for the film, but in 1989, he says, the demand for such projects collapsed, leaving him even deeper in the hole. His many creditors were closing in. "I was down to the point where every hour I was having to call and forestall bailiffs and court proceedings," he says.</p><p><span class="crosshead">`Dirty But Clean'</span> Broke, consumed by cocaine, and forced into court by creditors, he finally sought help. He managed to stave off legal bankruptcy, and two years of counseling helped him kick his drug habit. He had long been known to his friends as "Dirty Pierre," a nickname borrowed from a newspaper cartoon character. When he got the better of drugs, he expanded it to "Dirty But Clean," hence the initials "DBC."</p><p>He was not free of debt, though, and saw little prospect of making good on his promises to pay it all off.   "I went to London and tried to find work in the design field," he says. He found bits of work here and there over the next 10 years -- at one point he was working in Trinidad and Tobago -- but nothing permanent, nothing that could free him from debt and promise a stable future.</p><p>Increasingly discouraged, in 1999 he decided to try writing a novel. He wouldn't need to apply for a job to do it, nor would he have to borrow money. He needed only hope, talent, gumption -- and good luck.</p><p>"I had always kept the seed of the thought that I could do something creative on a bigger scale," he says, "and hoped I had developed the patience and discipline to go the length of it. It occurred to me that I could reunite the faith in me that people had had, and dig my way out -- if not financially, at least artistically."</p><p>Set in fictional Martirio, Texas, "Vernon God Little" is an over-the-top satirical take on American consumerism, mass media, police and prisons, and small-town life. Fifteen-year-old Vernon, whose main concern used to be how to get girls to notice him, is unjustly accused of complicity in a Columbine-style shooting in a local high school. He lights out for Mexico, but eventually is brought back for trial.</p><p>Pierre wrote a first draft in five weeks, rewrote it over the next 17 months, then sent it off to a dozen English literary agencies. Most did not reply, and the ones that did turned it down. He had about given up when he got an unexpected job offer as a commercial artist in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Riyadh held no appeal for him, but, he says, "It was God saying, `Here, take this and you're going to pay back all your debts, even though it won't be fun.' The day I was going to decide, I got a call from Clare Conville."</p><p>"Vernon God Little" had sat on the slush pile of Conville, a London literary agent, for four months. Then one of her readers read it, attached a note to it that said "This is great," and left it on her desk. In a telephone interview from London, Conville says she started reading the manuscript on her way home that night, and as the subway stations passed, her excitement increased.</p><p>"By Pimlico, I thought, `This first chapter is good, but he can't possibly follow through,' " she recalls. "By Vauxhall, I thought, `This is extraordinary,' and by Clapham North, I thought, `This is a masterpiece! I can't believe this hasn't been taken up!' "</p><p>She telephoned Pierre, signed him up, and rushed the manuscript to publishers. "It was sold within 12 hours in England," she says, "then very quickly in Japan and major countries in Europe." In October, it was published in the United States  by Canongate, a Scottish house with a  New York branch.</p><p><span class="crosshead">Beating the odds</span></p><p>The Man Booker finalists and winners are hotly debated in literary circles, and the judges' votes are scrutinized and dissected by the media. The prize is even handicapped by the betting industry. Pierre says "Vernon God Little" was given odds of 26-1 when the long list of finalists was announced, and he's kicking himself that he didn't place a bet.</p><p>The Man Booker winner gets a healthy sales bump in England, and often in the United States as well. (Last year's winner, Yann Martel's "Life of Pi," is No. 12 on the New York Times paperback fiction bestseller list.) What all that means to Pierre is that he can look forward finally to paying off all his debts. He has already repaid the friend whose apartment he sold.</p><p>Far from Mexico City and South Australia, DBC Pierre has lived for the past 18 months in an old house in County Leitrim, Ireland, where his farmer neighbors are fiercely protective of his privacy. After the Booker was announced and the British media descended on the area and asked for directions to his house, Pierre says with a laugh, "They told them, `Peter Finlay? Never heard of him,' and sent them round the mountain."</p><p>It's a good place to write, and Pierre has his second novel -- set in Europe, not Texas -- almost finished. "I'm nearly there," he says. "I only need a few more good weeks." This time, he has nothing to prove.</p><p><span class="tagline"></p><p>David Mehegan can be reached at mehegan@globe.com.</p><p></span></p>
