<span class="story"><p>Polly got her father's auger from his tool shed and hid it beneath a bush. Then she entered the house, innocently lugging her jug of ale. Private Reynolds gave her a sharp glance but said nothing. Abel smiled.</p><p>Polly's mother sat on the settle by the fire, mending.</p><p>"How are the Allens?" she asked.</p><p>"Too busy serving His Majesty's soldiers and sailors to have time to think," Polly replied.</p><p>"Well, that's a blessing of sorts, I suppose," her mother said.</p><p>Polly's father snorted. He and her five brothers had been obliged to put their featherbeds on the keeping room floor, where they were to spend the night under guard. The Daggett boys lay strewn about the room, reading and playing at cards, while Seth Daggett paced.</p><p>Polly picked up a book and sat down on the settle next to her mother. Rusty jumped up between them. Polly stroked her and pretended to read until it was fully dark, then she yawned.</p><p>"I'm going up to bed," she said, tucking Rusty under her arm and kissing her family members good night.</p><p>Upstairs, she fidgeted nervously. Would Maria and Nell be able to sneak away? Would she? At last she heard her mother bid everyone good night, then after a while everything grew quiet and still. It was time. Polly crept out into the hall and down the stairs, holding her breath. When she reached the bottom step she stopped and listened. She could hear Abel and Private Reynolds talking quietly in the keeping room. She tiptoed into the parlor and over to a window. It would be quieter, she thought, than the creaky front door. Turning the latch carefully, she tried to lift the window sash, but it was so swollen with rain that it wouldn't budge. She took a deep breath, tugging with all her might. This time the sash flew up with such force that it knocked her off balance. She fell against the window ledge.</p><p>"What was that?" she heard someone say. Then there were footsteps coming down the hall!</p><p>A shadow in the doorway!</p><p>A soldier stepped into the room!</p><p>Polly stared at Abel. Abel stared at her. Polly put a shaking finger to her lips.</p><p>Abel shook his head <i>no</i>. Polly nodded <i>yes</i>.</p><p>"What is it?" called Private Reynolds.</p><p>Abel stared at Polly a moment longer.</p><p><i>Please</i>, her eyes begged.</p><p>"Nothing," Abel said at last. "Just that cat." <i>Be careful</i>, he mouthed silently, then turned away.</p><p>With a sigh of relief, Polly slipped out through the window and silently pulled it closed behind her. She retrieved the auger and hurried to Manter's Hill. "Nell? Maria?" she whispered when she arrived.</p><p>There was no answer, but she could still hear laughter and fiddle music coming from Allen's tavern.</p><p>She ran her hand over the smooth wood of the Liberty Pole. "Your flag will fly again soon, Caleb," she whispered. "I promise." Then, with a sigh of resignation, she pressed the auger against the wood. The hole was very nearly finished when she saw two shadows gliding toward her across the grass.</p><p>"Sorry we're late," Maria whispered when they came close. "It was hard to slip away, especially with this pan of coals."</p><p>"Did anyone see you?" Polly asked.</p><p>"I don't think so," said Nell. She held up a powder horn. "I got the gunpowder like you asked."</p><p>"Good," said Polly. "The hole is almost done." She drilled a few moments more.</p><p>From the direction of the tavern they could hear voices and laughter. Some of the soldiers were starting to leave.</p><p>"Hurry!" whispered Maria.</p><p>Polly's hand was hurting, so Nell took over. When the hole was finished she filled it with powder.</p><p>"Wadding!" Maria whispered. "We forgot wadding."</p><p>"Wadding is just cloth," said Polly. "We've got plenty." She yanked up her skirt and ripped a long section of lace from the hem of her petticoat. She stuffed it into the hole.</p><p>"How do we light it without blowing our fingers off?"</p><p>Maria asked. Polly hesitated. "I hadn't thought about that," she said.</p><p>"Voices!" cried Maria suddenly. "Run!"</p><p>The three bolted toward an ancient oak tree a short distance away and hid behind it. Polly peeked out cautiously and saw three Redcoats coming right toward Manter's Hill!</p><p>"What if they see the hole?" whispered Maria.</p><p>"Or the sawdust?" Nell added.</p><p>"Hush," said Polly.</p><p>As the soldiers approached, the girls could tell that they were walking unsteadily. They were laughing and joking and bursting into short bits of song.</p><p>"They've had too much rum," said Polly. "They won't notice anything."</p><p>"The coals!" Maria cried. "I left the pan of coals on the ground!"</p><p>The soldiers were headed straight for the pole.</p><p>Polly bent down and dug a good-size rock out of the sandy soil. With all her strength, she hurled it toward the harbor. There was a gunshotlike report as the stone bounced off one of the large rocks along the shore then splashed into thewater. The soldiers' heads swiveled simultaneously.</p><p>"Who goes there?" one of them shouted toward the water.</p><p>"Come on!" said another, and they took off running down the hill toward the beach.</p><p>"That was impressive," said Nell. "How did you learn to throw like that?"</p><p>"Six brothers," Polly said simply.  "And I think I've figured out how to light the wadding." She pointed to a nearby garden where a number of beanpoles stood. She pulled one free of last year's vines and carried it to where the pan of coals lay.</p><p>"Hurry," Nell whispered. "Those soldiers could return any minute."</p><p>Polly wrapped lace around the end of the beanpole and lit it from the coals, then all three girls held the burning pole steady against the wadding until it caught fire.</p><p>"Run!" Polly cried, dropping the beanpole and grabbing the auger. The three raced for cover behind the tree, flattening themselves against the trunk.</p><p>Nothing happened. Polly peeked around.</p><p>"It went out," she said dejectedly.</p><p>"Forget it, then!" Maria cried. "Someone is going to see us for sure!"</p><p>"No," said Nell, quietly. "We have to try again."</p><p>"I thought you didn't believe in the war," said Polly.</p><p>"This is about saving lives, not taking them," said Nell. "If we can delay that ship even a few days maybe a battle won't take place, or at the very least, there will be fewer cannons firing on our troops."</p><p>Polly smiled. "Let's go," she said.</p><p>This time, they had no sooner reached the safety of the tree when a loud explosion echoed through the night. Sparks flew through the air</p><p>and then there followed a thundering crash. All three girls peeked around. The Liberty Pole lay in splinters.</p><p>"Daughters of Liberty,"</p><p>Polly whispered. "We did it!" Redcoats and villagers came running from all directions. Polly, Maria, and Nell crept from their hiding place and blended quietly into the crowd of onlookers. The captain of the Unicorn arrived in a great fury and demanded a house-by-house accounting of all the men of Homse's Hole. All the men had been secured, the guards assured him. Indeed, the men of Homse's Hole were as perplexed as the British over who was responsible.</p><p>The next day, Unicorn limped away without her mast, and the men of Homse's Hole debated the mystery of the Liberty Pole for many years to come. That <i>girls</i> might have been behind such a deed was never even contemplated, except perhaps by one. . . .</p><p>"We'll miss you," said Polly's mother on the day Abel announced that his company had been called to the front.</p><p>"Take care of yourself," said Polly's father, as grimly as if he were sending off his own son.</p><p>"Don't be a hero, Abel Butler," said Polly. "This isn't your war. It's King George's. Just get through it and get home safe to Yorkshire Dales as quickly as you can."</p><p>"I'll sure try, Miss Polly," said Abel. Then he winked. "And you keep that cat of yours in at night. He's a scrapper, and I wouldn't want to see any harm come to him." Polly's father looked puzzled.  "Actually," he said, "the cat's a she, and I very much doubt she has the disposition to fight."</p><p>Polly just smiled.</p><p><span class="tagline">Author's note: "The Liberty Pole" is based on a true event that took place in Homses Hole (present-day Tisbury) on Martha's Vineyard sometime between 1775 and 1778. As the story indicates, Tisbury was sympathetic to the patriot cause, but had no choice but to remain neutral in the early years of the war. The women of the town did stage their own "tea party" though, and there were other acts of defiance as time went on, including the raising of the Liberty Pole. Soon afterward, the men of the town formed the Sea Coast Defense and actively joined the rebellion. Little is known about the Liberty Pole event other than the fact that three young girls blew it up rather than see it commandeered by a British man-of-war. A replica of the pole still stands on Manter's Hill, inscribed with the names Polly Daggett, Parnell Manter, and Maria Allen. Although I've used the girls' real names and the real names of many other Homse's Hole folk, all of the characters in this story are fictional. Further information can be found at the Martha's Vineyard Historical Society (www.marthasvineyardhistory.org) and at www.history.vineyard.net.</span></p>
