<span class="story"><p>The folk of Homse's Hole comforted one another with assurances that Caleb Allen had not died in vain. The Americans had won the battle that cost him his life, the Battle of Dorchester Heights, and they had sent the British fleeing from Boston. The war was far from over, but this was a major victory. The people of Homse's Hole decided to erect a Liberty Pole in memory of Caleb Allen and in honor of all the men of Homse's Hole who were still fighting. Polly's father volunteered to make the pole and Polly, Maria, and Nell asked to make the flag.  They chose the flag recently adopted by the Massachusetts Navy: a green tree on a plain white background. It depicted the Liberty Tree, a large pine under which the Sons of Liberty had often rallied in Boston. Stitching the flag with care and love as they laughed and cried over their memories of Caleb brought some small measure of comfort to the three girls.</p><p>The shipwright offered a huge white pine he had been saving for a mast and Polly's father planed it and sanded it and varnished it until it shone like glass. When it was finished, the Liberty Pole was raised on Manter's Hill in plain view of the harbor.The British troops who were still quartered at Homse's Hole took a dim view of these goings on, but in the wake of the recent defeat at Boston, they seemed to think better of stirring the locals into a hornet's nest, especially over an issue as benign as a flagpole.</p><p>The flag raising was set for Saturday, April 14, on what would have been Caleb Allen's 18th birthday. Saturday morning dawned gray and threatening, with a strong onshore wind. "Nor'easter brewing," said Polly's father, with an eye to the sky.</p><p>"Do you think we should postpone the service?" Polly's mother asked.</p><p>"No," cried Polly. "It has to be today. It's Caleb's birthday.""Storm's a ways off yet," her father replied. "We'll have time."</p><p>Polly, Maria, and Nell stood hand in hand, biting back tears as their flag rose to the top of the pole."Caleb Allen died a hero," said Preacher Damon, who had come in from West Tisbury for the occasion. "He and other young men like him are planting the seeds of freedom, seeds that will one day flower in the farthest corners of the globe."</p><p>The wind whipped at Polly's skirt and tore at her bonnet. It gave her some comfort to think that perhaps this struggle was part of something bigger, that the world might one day be a better place because of Caleb's sacrifice. She had to believe that. Below the hill, the building sea crashed against the rocks that dotted the shore, sending plumes of spray into the air to be caught by the wind and sprinkled over the huddled group of mourners. Still the people of Homse's Hole sang and prayed and wept together, until at last the pelting rains arrived.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the day and long into the night the storm roared. Rain hammered on the rooftop and the angry wind hurled fistfuls of sand at the windowpanes. Rusty followed Polly everywhere, curling around her ankles for reassurance and huddling in her lap whenever she sat still for a moment. In truth, Polly was glad of the company. The bleak weather deepened her sorrow over Caleb and heightened her fears for her brother Sam.</p><p>Morning brought a different world. The sky was bright blue, the air bracing and clean. The whole town seemed freshly scoured. Polly was pleased upon coming down to breakfast to see that Caleb's flag had already been raised again. She stood a long while at the kitchen window just watching it furl and unfurl peacefully, bright white against the azure sky.</p><p>"Time to get to work now, Polly," said her mother. "It's not good to dwell too long on your sorrows."</p><p>Mama had her mind set on spring cleaning, so she and Polly donned their aprons and head kerchiefs and set to work scrubbing and washing, shaking rugs and beating featherbeds. Mama was right. Work felt good. At day's end, Polly mixed up a batch of corn bread and set it to  baking while her mother prepared a codfish stew. Polly was just setting out the trenchers and mugs for the evening meal when her father burst through the door like a wild man. "Not while I breathe!" he shouted. "Polly, fetch me my musket!"</p><p>To Polly's astonishment, Abel blew through the door right after her father.</p><p>"Please, Mr. Daggett," he implored, his own musket in hand. "Don't do this. You can't win."</p><p>"Don't do what?" Polly's mother cried. "What's going on?"</p><p>"That's going on!" her father replied, pointing back out through the open door.</p><p>Polly and her mother rushed to peer out. Down in the Hole was the British man-of-war Unicorn, her main mast snapped in half.</p><p>"Why are you so upset?" Polly's mother asked. "Her mast must have snapped in the storm."</p><p>"Her captain has commandeered the Liberty Pole to use as a new mast," Seth Daggett barked. "He says if we don't hand it over, he'll declare our refusal an act of treason and fire on the town."</p><p>"The Liberty Pole!" Polly cried. "But why can't they cut down a tree?"</p><p>"Because a tree is green lumber," Abel put in. "It needs time to cure, and the Liberty Pole is already. . . ."</p><p>"I won't have it!" Seth Daggett interrupted.</p><p>"Listen to reason, Mr. Daggett," said Abel. "That man-of-war has guns and men enough to make short work of Homse's Hole. And I can assure you, after the whippin' the British took at Boston, they're itching for reasons to punish you folks. Why give them one?"</p><p>Seth Daggett stood seething, clenching and unclenching his fists. "I'm going out," he said at last. He turned toward the door, but Abel barred his way.</p><p>"I'm afraid not, Mr. Daggett," he said. "We are under orders to hold the men and boys of Homse's Hole under house arrest until the morrow when the pole can be taken."</p><p>Seth Daggett's eyes narrowed. "I have treated you like a son these many months, boy," he said. "Will you raise arms against me?"</p><p>"I have no choice, sir," said Abel apologetically. He nodded over his shoulder. Polly looked to see another Redcoat approaching, gun in hand.</p><p>The Daggett family ate dinner in brooding silence under the watchful eyes of Abel and his fellow soldier, a stern-looking fellow named Private Reynolds. Rage burned within Polly. Homse's Hole could build another flagpole, but that wasn't the point. This was Caleb's flagpole. To think of it carrying a British man-of-war into battle against men like Caleb, maybe even against her brother Sam, was more than she could bear. She would rather see it destroyed.</p><p><i>Destroyed!</i></p><p>A shiver ran down her spine. That was it! The Liberty Pole had to be destroyed. But how? Polly kept her eyes lowered, hiding her growing excitement as her thoughts raced. "Mama," she whispered to her mother after dinner. "Maria will be distraught about all of this. I must go to her."</p><p>Her mother nodded, then glanced over at the soldiers. "Polly dear," she said loudly. "Take this jug and run over to the tavern, please. We're out of ale and I'm sure our <i>guests </i>(she nodded at Abel and Private Reynolds) will be glad of some refreshment before retiring." Abel and Private Reynolds exchanged glances.</p><p>"That is all right, isn't it?" Mrs. Daggett asked. "Or are we women under house arrest as well?"</p><p>Abel shrugged. "Captain didn't say anything about women," he said.</p><p>Polly grabbed the jug and took her shawl from its hook by the door.</p><p>"Mind you're back before dark," Private Reynolds warned. Polly hurried down the muddy lane, skirting the deep puddles left behind by the storm. A Redcoat barred the back door of Allen's Tavern.</p><p>"I'm sent to fetch ale for Private Butler and Private Reynolds," Polly told him.He looked at her empty jug, nodded and stepped aside.</p><p>The tavern was crowded with British soldiers and the keeping room was bustling as usual. Happily Nell was there, helping Maria keep up with the demands of the boisterous patrons. "Have you heard?" Polly whispered when she was able to pull them aside for a moment.</p><p>"Yes," said Maria, her eyes dark with anger.</p><p>"It is a travesty," said Nell."We must stop it," said Polly.</p><p>"How?" asked Maria and Nell.Polly glanced around carefully. "We're going to blow it up," she whispered.</p>
