<span class="story"><p>In September 1774, the Continental Congress voted to support Boston and stand up to the British. They set up the Continental Association to shut off trade with England. Throughout the colonies, militias met and trained secretly. Special units called Minutemen were formed to be ready to assemble and fight at a moment's notice. Homse's Hole had its own militia and a handful of Minutemen, but they knew they would be no match for the British Navy. It remained in their best interest to stay neutral, no matter what their hearts might dictate.  The British, for their part, were taking no chances. Martha's Vineyard was too important to naval operations to trust its accessibility to the loyalties of the Vineyarders. In late October, a British transport pulled into Homse's Hole and offloaded a regimen of British Regulars to be quartered in homes of the citizens, whether they liked it or not.  Because the Daggett home was relatively small and the Daggett family relatively large, only one soldier was to be quartered with them.</p><p>Polly was fully prepared to hate Private Abel Butler. She was not fully prepared for him to be a lonely, far-from-home, 17-year-old who loved cats, children, fishing in the Hole on his day off, and her mother's fresh baked corn bread.</p><p>"What business do you have coming over here and living in our house and eating our food and telling us how we can live?" Polly asked him petulantly when he first arrived.</p><p>"No business at all, Miss," Abel said apologetically. "If I had my way, I'd be home on our farm in the Yorkshire dales with my widowed Mum and my brothers and sisters. I don't give a fig about you Americans."</p><p>"So why did you come then?" asked Polly.</p><p>"Because when King George says you're in the army, you say `Yes, Sir!' and salute or else you'll find a bayonet, er . . . that is you'll find yourself in a heap of trouble. So here I am, like it or not."</p><p>Hard as it was to hate someone who so clearly bore you no ill will, Polly was determined to remain aloof. The British were the enemy, after all, and like it or not, it was Private Butler's job to enforce British rule and spy on the Daggetts and their friends and neighbors.</p><p>The winter came and went. Abel roughhoused with Polly's six brothers, helped her mother with chores, and lent her father a hand whenever he could. He even succeeded in charming Polly's cat, Rusty, who had long ago learned to give boys a wide berth. By spring, Abel had managed to win Polly over too.</p><p>"Am I a traitor, do you think?" she asked Maria and Nell one April afternoon. "I can hardly think of Abel as the enemy anymore. He has almost become a part of the family."</p><p>"Of course you're not a traitor," said Maria. The three girls sat peeling potatoes for a stew Maria's mother was preparing to serve in the tavern that night. "I think he's handsome and nice."</p><p>"Me, too," said Nell, who worked part time at the tavern for wages now. She flashed a sly grin. "You're sure it's sisterly thoughts you're having and not something more?"</p><p>"Nothing more. Quite sure," said Polly, putting her nose in the air. She did not add that her heart still belonged to Caleb, even though it had become increasingly obvious over the winter that Nell did return Caleb's affection.  Polly sighed.</p><p>Maria sighed, too. "I wish we had gotten Abel instead of those two bloody-backs we have staying here with us," she said. "All they ever do is order us about and run squealing to their superiors with every comment they overhear in the tap room."</p><p>"Hush," whispered Polly with a nervous glance at the taproom door.</p><p>"It's all right. They're not here now," said Maria. "They're drilling with their company out by Tashmoo Pond. I wish they'd all tumble in and drown."</p><p>"Well, nothing could be worse than that swine of a sergeant we have living with us," Nell pouted. "He's forever pinching me on the cheek and smacking me on the rump. It's not right that decent folk should have to tolerate such ruffi<b>-</b></p><p>ans." There was a footfall on the back doorstep, and all three girls jumped and turned as one. The door swung open and Caleb Allen strode in.</p><p>"Caleb," cried Maria. "You gave us a fright!" Then she laughed with relief. "We have all grown so jittery living under the constant watch of these British."</p><p>"Not for much longer," said Caleb gravely. "It has begun."</p><p>"What has begun?" asked Polly.</p><p>"The war," said Caleb.</p><p>A chill scurried up Polly's spine and tugged at the roots of her hair.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"How do you know?"</p><p>"When? How?"</p><p>"Hush, the three of you," Caleb replied to the</p><p>barrage of questions the girls were firing at him. "Dip me up a mug to quench my thirst and I will tell you the news that just came in with the ferry." Maria hurried down the cellar and quickly returned with a frothy mug.</p><p>Caleb took a deep draught, then straddled a chair and gazed at the three eager faces.</p><p>"It seems the British took a notion to arrest Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams to keep them from attending the 2nd Continental Congress in Philadelphia next month," he began.</p><p>"Which Mr. Adams?" Polly inquired.</p><p>"Samuel," replied Caleb. "General Gage is convinced that Samuel Adams and John Hancock are responsible for the rebellion."</p><p>"But what of Mr. Revere, Mr. Henry, Mr. John Adams?"</p><p>"They are all involved, certainly, and many more," Caleb said, "but General Gage believes that Sam Adams is the chief organizer and John Hancock the chief financier. Before he could move to arrest them, though, the two went into hiding at Mr. Hancock's sister's home in Lexington."</p><p>"Are they there still?" asked Nell.</p><p>"Listen, my lovely lady, and you will hear," Caleb chided gently. He took another sip from his mug.</p><p>"Gage learned of the whereabouts of Adams and Hancock through his spies,"  Caleb went on, "and he also learned that the local militias around Boston had stockpiled gunpowder and cannons at Concord, 5 miles beyond Lexington. This Tuesday past, Gage sent 800 men marching by moonlight to Lexington, with instructions to arrest Hancock and Adams, then march on to take the munitions at Concord.</p><p>"They arrived at dawn, but word had preceded them. They found 60 or so militiamen waiting for them on the Lexington Green."</p><p>"Sixty? Against eight hundred?" Maria cried. "Surely the Redcoats did not fire on so small a company!" "They did," said Caleb, his eyes narrowing. "Or someone did. The British say it was the colonists that fired first. The colonists claim it was the British. I have my opinion. I'll leave you to form yours. But whoever fired first, when the smoke cleared, eight Americans lay dying and 10 more wounded."</p><p>Polly let out a small cry. Nell put her hand to her mouth.</p><p>"And the British?" Maria inquired.</p><p>"One man wounded only," said Caleb. "Was that the end of it?" asked Polly.</p><p>"Far from it," Caleb declared. "The British marched off toward Concord, leaving the dead and dying, but in a thrice, the Minutemen sent riders out in all directions. By the time the Redcoats reached Concord, three companies of local militia were waiting and reinforcements were racing in from all directions. Shots broke out and two more Americans died."</p><p>Polly's stomach began to ache. She was not sure she wanted to hear more. Nell and Maria were wide-eyed and pale, but Caleb's voice was rising with excitement.</p><p>"The Americans returned fire and three British fell," he declared, "then the whole British company turned tail and ran!"</p><p>"They  retreated?" cried Polly incredulously.</p><p>"Yes," said Caleb, "and we harried them all the way back to Boston! A thousand fresh British troops came out to save their hides, but by then, the Americans were almost 4,000 strong!"</p><p>"You mean, we won?" Maria asked incredulously.</p><p>"That's what I mean, Maria my girl," said Caleb, his eyes shining. "We showed those Lobsterbacks a thing or two. They lost almost 300 men to our one hundred, and now we've got all the roads in and out of Boston blockaded. They're trapped."</p><p>"So so the war is over?" Polly stammered.</p><p>"Over?" Caleb laughed. "I'm afraid not, sprout. The British still own the seas, don't forget." He got up from his chair, went over to the hearth and lifted his father's old fowling piece down from above the mantle.
