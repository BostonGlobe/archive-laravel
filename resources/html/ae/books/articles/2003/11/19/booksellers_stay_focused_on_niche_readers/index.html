<span class="story"><p>For many, the key to survival is to specialize. But even that is no certain route to success. The venerable Swedenborg  Bookstore on Newbury Street, specializing in the works of the philosopher Emanual  Swedenborg, recently closed, and Cambridge Architectural Books on Bow Street in Cambridge shut down earlier this year.</p><p>There are still plenty of little niche bookshops around -- some for-profit, some nonprofit -- if you know where to look. While some booksellers seem to be in good shape, others acknowledge that it's an edge-of-the seat game at best. To hear their stories, we dashed around town, by T and on foot, and visited a selection.</p><p>The most famous in its small field is <b>Grolier Poetry Book Shop</b> at 6 Plympton St., Cambridge, the oldest all-poetry store in the United States. Owner Louisa Solano, who had loved the store from the time she was a student at Cambridge Latin School,  bought it in 1974 from the estate of cofounder Gordon Cairnie, who had managed it since 1927. In addition to selling new books, Solano has actively promoted poetry, with readings and the Grolier Poetry Prize Annual. The tiny store is roughly square in shape,  and its  milky-white hanging lights have the aspect of an old-fashioned school library. Above the shelves are photographs of poets who have visited the store, including Marianne Moore, T.S. Eliot,  Allen Ginsberg,  and Donald Hall.</p><p>Solano says Harvard University, her landlord, understands the challenges she faces in  keeping such a store going. It's a for-profit business, at least in theory, yet friends of the Grolier at times have gamely pitched in with fund-raisers. Many poets have been devoted friends. One worrisome trend: General stores are carrying more poetry than in the past. Besides that, Solano says, browsers  are dwindling. Her inventory has dropped from an  average of 19,000 titles to 16,000. Still, Solano is at her post, seemingly as enduring as poetry itself. "If nothing else, I am persistent," she says. "I am stubborn."</p><p>Halfway down Boston's short Bromfield Street, at No. 41, is the shop of the<b> Massachusetts Bible Society</b>.  With its decidedly Victorian feel, the shop sells every major translation of the Bible, along with other spiritual books, children's books, and gifts. As part of a larger nonprofit institution (which owns the building), the shop need not fear the financial wolf at the door as others do.</p><p>While churches form an important part of the customer base, walk-in business is significant, too, and you can find the Bible in such languages as Turkish and Apache. "We may not be the most fascinating bookstore in Boston," says manager Amy Ward, "but we're close to it."</p><p>A quiet bookselling landmark is Brookline's <b>Israel Book Shop</b>, at 410 Harvard St., near Coolidge Corner. The well-stocked store carries books, software, and CDs of Judaic interest -- spiritual, educational, and secular -- with a national mail-order clientele. It also has a large gift business.</p><p>Besides Bibles, Talmudic works, prayer books, and cantors' songbooks, the shop imports Israeli textbooks and children's literature and works of Jewish history and biography. There are reference books, foreign-language books, videos, and CDs. The store serves all branches of Judaism, from Orthodox to Reform. Books on the shelves range from "Moe Berg: The Spy Behind Home Plate"  to "When God Becomes History: Historical Essays by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook." Owner Eli Dovek founded the store in 1957 because, he says,  as a former rabbinical student he knew there was a great demand for the best new educational materials. "I felt a store like ours would be needed," Dovek says, "and thanks to God, we succeeded."</p><p>Not far away, in a basement store at 1217A Commonwealth Ave., Boston, is a shop  with a straightforward name: <b>Russian Bookstore</b>.   Owned by Irina Braun, the little  shop is a  component of her Internet book business (www.panrus.com).  Braun bought the 15-year-old business -- the first store in New England catering to Russian immigrants -- last spring  and kept the simple name because it was unmistakable.</p><p>The shop is compact  but thickly stocked and meets a need among customers who aren't Internet-savvy or who want to browse in person. "We have more nonfiction, academic, intellectual books" than other Russian-language stores, Braun says. "We try to find books for practically every potential buyer: children's books, foreign fiction, Russian videos, CDs, books on tape, Russian periodicals -- we have a little of everything." It's not just for the Russian community, she says. "We want to attract people who want to learn Russian."</p><p>Around the corner from the Grolier, at 76A Mount Auburn St., is <b>Schoenhof's Foreign Books</b>.  At 147 years, it may be the oldest for-profit bookstore in the area. Founded by Karl Schoenhof on Washington Street in downtown Boston, the store initially  sold mostly French and German literature. It  moved to Cambridge after World War I and to its present location after it was bought in 1981 by Editions Gallimard, a French specialty publisher.</p><p>Though it's part of a bigger company, Schoenhof's  has a unique niche in a region with vast numbers of foreign-language readers. And it's perfectly located in a college area. Its biggest business is books on foreign language,   with 700 to 800 titles. Manager Rupert Davis says the place bustles  just before new college semesters begin; for some books assigned by foreign-language professors,  Schoenhof's is the only local source. But not all customers are local. Davis recalls some recent visitors from New York. "They bought some German books," he says, "and lamented there was no place in Manhattan selling the titles that we had."</p><p>Some general booksellers have made their moves early.  Martin Weinkle once owned three general bookstores under the name <b>Buddenbrooks</b>,  the largest of which was on Boylston Street near Exeter Street. It was a classic shop, with wood floors and a cat in the window, but when superstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble (and for a short time around the corner, Waterstone's) began to sprout up around town with radical price discounts, he saw the handwriting on the wall. Persuaded, he says, of  "the inability of most independents to compete unless they are in some small niche," he closed his stores in 1992 and opened a new Buddenbrooks at 31 Newbury St., selling only rare and antiquarian books.</p><p>With no outside sign, the second-floor shop is hard to find. The note on the frosted-glass locked door upstairs advises visitors to "knock firmly" to be admitted. That seemed a bit chilly, but  the welcome by Annie Weinkle,  Martin's wife, and associate Stephen Pepple was notably warm. The interior feels like a private library, with hardwood floors, oriental rugs, tables, and glass cases.</p><p>Much of Weinkle's business is with regular clients. Off-street visitors are not unwelcome, he says, but the books are so special that a lot of casual handling would be unwise. His stock is wide-ranging, including literature of all ages, first editions, and early printed books. Examples of books you won't find at Barnes &amp; Noble: a 16th-century first edition of Galileo's "Dialogo," a 17th-century first edition of Newton's "Principia," and a 1632 folio of Shakespeare's plays.</p><p><b>Kate's Mystery Books</b> occupies a red Victorian house at 2211 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge. She carries only books, all mysteries. The interior is delightfully dim, rather like the Addams Family mansion, with  track lighting directed on the books, which fill shelves up to the ceiling. Owner Kate Mattes started the store in 1983, at a time, she says, when the stock of mystery fiction at most general bookstores was meager. She has new and used, hardcover and paperback titles, and she tries to carry every book of mystery fiction in print. For her it's a labor of love. "I hate it when someone comes in and leaves with nothing," she says.</p><p>Mattes works hard at her business, with a newsletter, website, and author appearances to attract customers. "I'm fortunate that I have loyal customers who help me know what to order. I know what certain people like," she says. She has also started her own publishing imprint  in collaboration with Boston-based publisher Justin, Charles &amp; Co.</p><p>Mattes acknowledges that even in her niche -- which she will soon no longer share  with Spenser's -- she has a never-ending financial struggle. She has unusual assets: She owns the building, lives upstairs, and rents an apartment in the back. And she has no paid staff, only volunteers. "I don't know how other bookstores stay in business," she says.</p><p>Along with many Russian-speakers, the Boston area has about 10,000 Japanese speakers and readers, and for them there is <b>Sasuga Japanese Bookstore</b>,  at 7 Upland Road, across Massachusetts Avenue from the Porter Square T  station. Started 10 years ago by Karen and Minoru Yahara, the 1,000-square-foot store has a range of fiction and nonfiction, plus a few gift items. One whole wall is packed tight with the explosively popular graphic fiction known as Manga.</p><p>"We had a great start," Karen Yahara says, "business zoomed up, and for a while we had two stores." They closed the second eventually and concentrated on building their Internet business. Oddly, she says, the in-store customers are mostly  Japanese,  nearly the opposite of  the case for their Internet sales.   Business got tougher after 9/11, with Japanese parents nervous about their college-age children coming to the United States, and fewer Japanese in general were traveling to Boston. Still, Karen Yahara is upbeat and says she and her husband are still having fun. "Boston needs a Japanese bookstore," she says.</p><p>Common to all these booksellers, it seems, is a love of books or a commitment to a particular brand of reader. It's clear in talking to most of them, though, that bookselling is not for the faint of heart. Litera scripta manet,  as the Latin phrase has it: The written word remains. But too often the bookstore does not.</p><p><span class="tagline"> David Mehegan can be reached at mehegan@globe.com.</span></p>
