<article_title>Bradley makes his book pitch</article_title>

<article_body><p>NBA Hall of Famer <strong>Bill Bradley</strong> was at Fenway yesterday, but not for the game. The former Democratic presidential candidate spoke about his new book, "The New American Story." . . . So much for <strong>Christopher Lydon</strong>'s radio show "Open Source," at least on WGBH-FM. The station confirmed yesterday that since Public Radio International will no longer be distributing the show, it won't be airing on 89.7 after June 30. Lydon could not be reached yesterday.</p>

<p>Delp tribute is on</p>
</div>

<p>Looks like the rumored show honoring the late Brad Delp will take place after all. Word is that <strong>Tom Scholz</strong> and the surviving members of Boston will pay tribute to the band's late singer at the Bank of America Pavilion Aug. 19. It'd be the first time in more than two decades that Scholz has shared the stage with fellow Boston members <strong>Barry Goudreau</strong>, <strong>Fran Sheehan</strong>, and <strong>John "Sib" Hashian</strong>. Others expected to pay tribute to Delp, who committed suicide in March, include <strong>Sully Erna</strong> and Godsmack, Cheap Trick singer <strong>Robin Zander</strong>, Extreme singer <strong>Gary Cherone</strong>, <strong>Ernie Boch</strong>'s band Ernie &amp; the Automatics, and Beatlejuice.</p>

<p>What's in a name for chef Chang?</p>
</div>

<p>Chef <strong>Joanne Chang</strong> (inset) and her fiance, restaurateur <strong>Christopher Myers</strong>, are finally opening the Asian eatery in the South End that they've been talking about. Look for it at the corner of East Berkeley and Washington this fall. But the duo -- she's the power behind Flour; he co-owns Radius, Via Matta, and Great Bay -- say they <em>still</em> don't have a name. Ones they're considering? Rice , Myers &amp; Chang , Formosa , and Bang Bang. "Usually when you name a restaurant you're picking between a hundred you don't like," Myers said. This much they do know: The chef will be <strong>Alison Hearn</strong>, who previously worked at B&amp;G Oysters and Ten Tables.</p>

<p>Film fest not grounded</p>
</div>

<p>The continued problems of Cape Air apparently aren't crimping the style of the celebs attending this weekend's Nantucket Film Festival. Near as we can tell, everyone who's supposed to be on the island is there or on the way. (Hooray for private jets!) Actor <strong>Steven Weber</strong>, who, ironically, played an island pilot on the '90s sitcom "Wings," had no trouble making it to the opening-night party at Straight Wharf restaurant, nor did TV and film director <strong>Jace Alexander</strong>, son of actress <strong>Jane Alexander</strong>. Yesterday, Jace hosted a morning coffee with <strong>Jake Paltrow</strong>, younger brother of <strong>Gwyneth</strong>, and writer-director of the new movie "The Good Night."</p>

<p>Assessing treatment</p>
</div>

<p>Even before <strong>Michael Moore</strong>'s latest muckraking movie has been released, the battle lines are being drawn. On one side of "SiCKO" is the insurance lobby, which takes a dim view of Moore's documentary about the state of healthcare in the United States. On the other are true believers like <strong>Ann Eldridge Malone</strong> of the Mission Hill-based Alliance to Defend Health Care. "I expect Moore's movie will be a very important and powerful tool in building a just healthcare system," said Malone, who will be in Manchester, N.H., next week when Moore holds a town hall-style meeting to discuss the film.</p>

 

<p><strong>She's got style</strong></p>

<p>For a fashion designer, <strong>Jackie Rogers</strong> (right) is refreshingly unpretentious. "I'm glad this is how it turned out," she says of her illustrious life, "but it's not like I followed a plan." In Boston for a trunk show at the Back Bay manse of actress <strong>Christy Scott Cashman</strong>, Rogers told us yesterday she strives to make her creations comfortable and not too complex. "I don't do darts and I don't do a lot of construction," said the Brookline native, who once modeled for Coco Chanel and Bill Blass. Standing with her fall collection in the foyer of Cashman's crib, Rogers looked satisfied and, of course, stylish.</p>

<p>His chips came in</p>
</div>

<strong>Saro Getzoyan</strong>
<p>had a good week. Really good. The 27-year-old Lexington lad cleaned up at the World Series of Poker this week in Las Vegas, finishing first in the $5,000 buy-in "Limit-Hold'em World Championship." The win, worth $333,379, was remarkable considering Getzoyan, an MIT grad who is a software developer, started the table with the second-smallest chip count. We couldn't reach Getzoyan, but he told a WSOP official that "money doesn't change anything." No, it just makes life a little easier.</p>

 

<p><strong>Chipping in for a good cause</strong><br />
The kindly clothiers at Louis, Boston celebrated Goodwill Industries yesterday with a pitch-and-putt party on the grounds of the tony Back Bay retailer. Do-gooders on fashionable femme <strong>Debi Greenberg 's guest list included Mayor</strong> Tom Menino, ex-Patriot <strong>Max Lane</strong> (above right with Greenberg and Menino), current Pats players <strong>Rosevelt Colvin</strong>, <strong>Lonie Paxton</strong>, and <strong>Wes Welker</strong>, former Bruin <strong>Cam Neely</strong>, and stylist <strong>Mario Russo</strong>.</p>

<p>New prison for Paris</p>
</div>

 <strong>Paris Hilton</strong>
<p>was transferred back to an all-women's jail because her condition was declared stable after nearly a week in a medical ward, a sheriff's official said yesterday. Hilton was brought late Wednesday to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, Calif., and placed in the medical clinic there. If all goes well, she will return to the jail's special needs unit and be released June 25, said spokesman <strong>Steve Whitmore</strong>. The 26-year-old socialite and reality TV star began her 45-day sentence June 3, was sent home three days later for an unspecified medical condition, and was returned to jail last Friday. (AP)</p>

<p>FBI picks up boy-band mogu l</p>
</div>

<strong>Lou Pearlman</strong>
<p>was forced out of hiding yesterday and flown to Guam after being expelled by Indonesian authorities and turned over to the FBI. Pearlman's arrest on one felony count of bank fraud ended several months of hiding for the boy-band mogul, who created the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. He also faces several lawsuits and two involuntary bankruptcy proceedings but hasn't responded to court subpoenas and doesn't have an attorney in either bankruptcy case. Banks are hounding Pearlman and his companies for more than $120 million, according to court documents. (AP)</p>

<p>Fabolous walks</p>
</div>

<p>A judge has dismissed illegal weapons charges against <strong>Fabolous</strong> that put the Brooklyn rapper behind bars for a night in October. Fabolous was arrested Oct. 17 after he was treated for a minor gunshot wound following a wild night at Justin's, a Manhattan restaurant and club owned by <strong>Sean "Diddy" Combs</strong>. A prosecutor said yesterday that authorities were unable to prove that Fabolous, 27, or three co-defendants were the owners of two loaded handguns found in a car in which they had ridden. The trouble began when someone snatched a $50,000 chain off the neck of then-Boston Celtics point guard <strong>Sebastian Telfair</strong>. (AP)</p>

<p>Contempt warning in Spector trial</p>
</div>

<p>The judge in <strong>Phil Spector</strong>'s murder trial threatened yesterday to hold a former attorney for the record producer in contempt if she refuses to testify about possible evidence that was never given to prosecutors. In a hearing without the jury present, Superior Court Judge <strong>Larry Paul Fidler</strong> said he wanted to avoid holding <strong>Sara Caplan</strong> in contempt but saw no other choice. He deferred the issue until Monday and ordered the trial to resume with other witnesses. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson in the mouth at his suburban mansion on Feb. 3, 2003. He claims she shot herself. (AP)</p>

<p>It's a heartache for Stewart</p>
</div>

<strong>Rod Stewart</strong>
<p>'s 26-year-old son, <strong>Sean</strong>, was arrested this week on charges he assaulted a couple with a brick. Stewart was taken into custody on a warrant charging him with four felony counts, including assault with a deadly weapon, throwing a substance at a vehicle, and vandalism, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said. Stewart, one of the stars of A&amp;E Network's reality show "Sons of Hollywood," was released on $60,000 bail. (AP)</p></article_body>
